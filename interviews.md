## [082: Neil Sattin Interview — Cognitive Distortions and Relationships](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/082-neil-sattin-interview-cognitive-distortions-and-relationships) - [transcript](https://www.neilsattin.com/blog/2018/03/133-change-thoughts-change-life-cognitive-distortions-dr-david-burns/)

This interview was first published on Neil Sattin's highly regarded [Relationship Alive Podcast](https://www.neilsattin.com/). Although some of the material may be familiar, there's much that's new, and you will enjoy the chemistry between Neil and David as they discuss each of the ten cognitive distortions and raise many challenging questions, such as:
* Is it **really** true that only our thoughts--and NOT external events--can change the way we feel?
* If someone has the belief, "I'm unlovable," isn't that type of thought immutable? How could you possibly change or modify a thought that may be rooted in traumatic experiences and so deeply embedded in a patient's psyche?
* Should we try to change other people's cognitive distortions, or just our own?
* How can we challenge each of the ten cognitive distortions?
And much more!

### [090: Roy Germano Interview — How David Became an Anti-Antidepressant Crusader and a Bestselling Author](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/090-roy-germano-interview-how-david-became-an-anti-antidepressant-crusader-and-a-bestselling-author)

I was recently interviewed by author, professor, and documentary filmmaker Roy Germano for his outstanding Other Side Podcast. Fabrice and I thought you might enjoy this interview, and Roy graciously gave us permission to share it with you.

You will get some personal glimpses into the early days of my career, including why I left academics to pursue a full-time private practice, along with some of controversies about antidepressants. You will also hear a story of what happened when I was trying, rather unsuccessfully, to get my first book, **Feeling Good**, published. It wasn’t easy, and it almost didn’t happen!

Roy is terrific and his podcasts cover a wide range of topics. You can find [his podcasts on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/other-side-with-roy-germano/id1355438604?mt=2).

Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:00:00 +0000

I recently did the first of three interviews with Stephanie James on her superb radio show and [podcast, **The Spark**](https://www.thesparkpod.com/episodes/).  Here’s how Stephanie described the interview (with minor changes):

We have amazing power within us to change our thoughts, our feelings, our actions, and our lives.

This episode is an inspirational way to take control of your automatic negative thoughts today and transform them in order to create a more joyful present and a more fulling future.

Join us as we talk with the legendary [Dr. David Burns](https://feelinggood.com/) about how we can break through the old thinking habits that bind us and begin to live a more happy, harmonious life where we can feel good now.
Stephanie is a superb therapist and dynamic radio personality from Colorado. It was an honor to be on her show. She is co-authoring a book on how to live a “spark-filled life.” It should be completed soon, so you’ll likely be hearing from Stephanie a lot next year!

### [100: The New Micro-Neurosurgery — A Remarkable Interview with Dr. Mark Noble](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/episode-100-the-new-micro-neurosurgery-a-remarkable-interview-with-dr-mark-noble)

> Mark is a Stanford-trained geneticist and molecular biologist who is considered one of founders of the field of stem cell research. He has been developing a model of how TEAM-CBT affects the brain, and graciously agreed to present his model at our Tuesday evening Stanford TEAM-CBT seminar last week. Although his model is not yet fully polished and refined, and involves considerable speculation, it is an exciting first step, kind of like the time when astronomers broke away from the Catholic church and started trying to make sense of the universe. In this instance it is the “inner universe” Dr. Noble, all of us, are trying to understand. His model will evolve and get more and more refined over time.

> Dr. Noble describes brain function in terms of the SNEFF model. This stands for Structures, Networks, Emotions, Frames and Filters, and links these concepts to the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and sympathetic nervous system. Then he describes the four steps of TEAM (T = Testing, E = Empathy, A = (Paradoxical) Agenda Setting, and M = Methods), and links each step to the SNEFF model, making interesting speculations on how TEAM works and what makes it so effective.

> Dr. Noble also discusses David’s “fractal” theory about psychotherapy and relates that to brain function as well as to the mathematics of complex structures. He describes how and why some people get stuck in the “homeostasis” of chronic, refractory depression and explains why TEAM-CBT is usually able to trigger sudden and dramatic changes in the brain, as well as in the way the depressed and anxious individual thinks, feels, and behaves. He also explains why conventional talk therapy is unlikely to be helpful for individuals struggling with depression and anxiety, and may, in some cases, make the depression worse.

### [107: Interview of Dr. Taylor Chesney — Secrets of TEAM-CBT with Kids](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/107-interview-of-dr-taylor-chesney-secrets-of-team-cbt-with-kids)

> Fabrice and David are pleased to chat with Dr. Taylor Chesney who is an expert in the treatment of children and teenagers with TEAM-CBT. Taylor was a member of Dr. Burns’ Tuesday group at Stanford and his Sunday hiking group for two years before returning to her home in New York in 2014. She opened the Feeling Good Institute NYC, where she and her colleagues offer individual and intensive treatment as well as training for mental health professionals (in person and online). Today she reveals the inside scoop on how to use TEAM-CBT with children and teenagers, and their parents.

### [111: Stephanie James Interview (Part 2) — On the Road to Feeling Great](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/092-stephanie-james-interview-part-2-on-the-road-to-feeling-great)

This interview with Stephanie focused, in part, on the evolution of the new TEAM-CBT from traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Stephanie asks Dr. Burns questions on a wide range of topics, including:

* How would you treat a case of social anxiety?
* What is “therapeutic whitewashing” and how can therapists get over it? What should therapists do instead?
* How would you work with violent incarcerated teenagers, such as gang members?
* Why is it so important for therapists who are learning TEAM-CBT to check their egos at the door?
* After you published your first book, Feeling Good, and the first research study on CBT was published, cognitive therapy swept the world. After your initial euphoria, your enthusiasm dimmed somewhat. Why? And what new direction did your research lead?
* What are the most common errors that therapists make in thinking about the causes of therapeutic resistance?
* How can you overcome a patient’s resistance to change?
* Can TEAM-CBT work rapidly for someone with horrific abuse and decades of failed therapy?
* How can you prevent relapses following the patient’s initial recovery?
