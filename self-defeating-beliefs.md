Rajesh asked:
* Is it possible to change an SDB?
* Does the mere knowledge of an SDB change it?
* How long does it take to change an SDB?
* How do you change SDBs?

Nikola asked:
* Aaron Beck said the SDBs never really go away. They just get activated and deactivated and activated again. Does this mean that depression is an incurable disease that will keep coming back over and over again?
* What’s the point in battling against a core belief if it cannot be changed?
Fabrice and I appreciate your questions--they often give us ideas for shows! In today’s Podcast you'll learn the answers to several questions about Self-Defeating Beliefs.

**What’s the difference between Self-Defeating Beliefs (SDBs) vs. Cognitive Distortions?**

The thoughts that contain cognitive distortions, such as All-or-Nothing Thinking, Overgeneralization, Discounting the Positive, and Self-Blame are distortions of reality, they are the cons that trigger depression and anxiety. When you're upset, these thoughts will flood your mind. These thoughts can be show to be false, and when you crush a distorted negative thought, you'll immediately feel better.

Self-Defeating Beliefs are stipulations, values that you've set up for your self. For example, you may base your self-esteem on your accomplishments due to your belief that people who accomplish more are more worthwhile as human beings. SDBs like this cannot actually be shown to be false--they are simply your personal, subjective values, and they are thought to be with you all the time, and not just when you're depressed, anxious, or angry.

The question with an SDB is this: What are the advantages and disadvantages of having this value system? How will it help me--what are the benefits--and how might it hurt me? What's the downside?

**Why are Self-Defeating Beliefs thought to be important?**

When you challenge and defeat a distorted thought, you feel better in the here-and-now. When you challenge and change an SDB, you change your value system at a deep level. This is thought to make you less vulnerable to painful mood swings and relationship conflicts in the future.

**What are the different kinds of SDBs?**

### [119: Self-Defeating Beliefs (Part 2) — Can You Change Them?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/119-self-defeating-beliefs-part-2-can-you-change-them)

**How can you get rid of [Self-Defeating Beliefs](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Self-Defeating-Beliefs-list-v-1.pdf)?**

Although any of the 100 + TEAM-CBT methods can be used to modify an SDB, four methods will be highlighted in today's show.

* Cost-Benefit Analysis
* Semantic Method
* Experimental Technique
* Feared Fantasy

For more information on how to change SDBs, you might want to watch the extremely popular David and Jill  FB Live show on [Overcoming Perfectionism](https://www.facebook.com/DavidBurnsMD/videos/548965778908540/) (recorded on November 11, 2018).

**What research has been done on SDBs?**

This topic was not discussed in the show, but individuals with an interest in research might want to read David’s study with Dr. Jackie Persons on the causal connections between depression and SDBs about dependency (attachment) as well as achievement (perfectionism) in several hundred patients in Philadelphia during the first 12 weeks of their treatment at David’s clinic.

The study confirmed That both types of SBS were significantly correlated with depression severity at intake and at the 12-week evaluation. In addition, changes in depression were correlated with changes in SDBs. However, a sophisticated statistical analysis with structural equation modeling techniques did not confirm that SDBs had causal effects on depression, or that depression had causal effects on SDBs. Instead, SDBs and feelings of depression appeared to share an unknown common cause.
