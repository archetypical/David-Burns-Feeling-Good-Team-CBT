### [063: Ask David — What’s Good About Hopelessness or Addiction? What Is it to Be a Worthwhile Human Being?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/063-ask-david-whats-good-about-hopelessness-or-addiction-what-is-it-to-be-a-worthwhile-human-being)

Is there anything positive about hopelessness or an addiction ? What does it take to be a "worthwhile" human being, or to have a valuable life?

In today’s podcast, David and Fabrice address three questions submitted by listeners:

* Avi asks another great question about the importance of Positive Reframing in TEAM-CBT. But how can we possibly find something positive in the feeling of hopelessness. After all, Dr. Aaron Beck has taught us that it's the worst emotion of all!
* Avi asks a similar question about an addiction. How can an addiction possibly be a good thing?
* Eugene asks a tremendous question about a passage in Dr. Burns' book, **Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy**, on the topic of what it means to be a worthwhile human being, and what it takes to make a life valuable. Eugene hints that Dr. Burns may have the wrong idea, and asks what he would say to a patient who doesn't "cry uncle!"
David and Fabrice love your questions so keep them coming!

### [115: Healing Addiction with Stephen Pfleiderer](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/115-healing-addiction-with-stephen-pfleiderer)

Fabrice and I were thrilled to interview our dear friend and colleague, Stephen Pfleiderer, who is the first therapist in the world using TEAM-CBT techniques in the treatment of habits and addictions, including

* life threatening addictions, like intravenous heroin or meth
* marijuana
* alcohol
* binge eating
* procrastination
* smoking
* internet porn
* and more

Stephen begins with his personal story of excessive beer drinking starting in high school through his junior year in college when he hit a personal crisis, telling himself, "My life sucks. I can't live like this. I'm a loser." He decided to enter a 12-step recovery program, which helped tremendously, and eventually joined David's weekly TEAM training group at Stanford because of his dream of becoming a professional addiction therapist and interventionist.

### [117: Stephanie James Interview (Part 3) — The Trifecta of Feeling Terrific](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/117-stephanie-james-interview-part-3-the-trifecta-of-feeling-terrific)

I recently did two terrific interviews (Podcasts #92 and #111) with Stephanie James on her superb radio show and podcast, **<u>[The Spark](https://www.thesparkpod.com/episodes/)</u>**. Today, Fabrice and I are bringing you my third and final interview with Stephanie, as we describe how to convert conflicted relationships into loving, rewarding ones.

Stephanie said it was her favorite interview, although all three were really fun for me. Today you will once again hear how dynamic, warm and positive she is!

My first interview with Stephanie was on the amazing inner power we all have to change our thoughts, feelings, actions, and lives. We talked about how to transform your automatic negative thoughts and create a more joyful present and a more fulfilling future.

My second interview with Stephanie was on the evolution of traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) into the new TEAM-CBT. We highlighted the amazing new motivation-busting techniques that can lead to extraordinarily rapid recovery.

Stephanie also recently interviewed our beloved colleague, Dr. Matthew May, a psychiatrist who is a phenomenal TEAM therapist. [Click here if you'd like to take a look and listen](https://www.thesparkpod.com/episodes/029-breakthrough-to-healing-with-dr-matthew-may/.

Matt has worked with Fabrice and me on our podcasts--you may remember the amazing and inspiring podcasts featuring [live therapy with Marilyn.](https://feelinggood.com/2017/08/07/049-live-session-marilyn-testing-empathy-part-1/)

Stephanie is a outstanding therapist and radio personality from Colorado. It was an honor to be on her show on three occasions. Stephanie is co-authoring a book on how to live a “spark-filled life.” It should be completed soon, so you’ll likely be hearing much more from Stephanie during 2019!
