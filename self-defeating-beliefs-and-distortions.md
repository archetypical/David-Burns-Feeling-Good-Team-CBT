## Negative and Positive Distortions

[Cognitive Distortion](https://en.wikibedia.ru/wiki/Cognitive_distortion) - en.wikibedia.ru
  > Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. According to the cognitive model of Beck, a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called negative schemas (or schemata), is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns reinforce negative emotions and thoughts. During difficult circumstances, these distorted thoughts can contribute to an overall negative outlook on the world and a depressive or anxious mental state.

**“My problems are real! The world really IS screwed up! And that’s not a distortion. So what can I do about my severe depression and anxiety?”**

> #1. Shari writes: 'how can we attend to our own emotional well-being in the face of genuine adversity?'
> #2. After listening to the A = Agenda Setting portion of the live therapy with Mark, Paul submitted this question:

> I am wondering what your thoughts are on how effectively the "A" step can be carried out by a patient on his/her own (i.e. without someone else verbalizing the reasons not to change / playing the part of the patient's sub-conscious)? Do you have any tips? I think I heard Mark say something to the effect that, on his own, he wouldn't have thought of all the positives that you came up with in the session.

> * Is it **really** true that only our thoughts--and NOT external events--can change the way we feel?
> * If someone has the belief, "I'm unlovable," isn't that type of thought immutable? How could you possibly change or modify a thought that may be rooted in traumatic experiences and so deeply embedded in a patient's psyche?
> * Should we try to change other people's cognitive distortions, or just our own?
> * How can we challenge each of the ten cognitive distortions?
And much more!

#### [038: Ask David — Negative Messages from Society](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/038-ask-david-negative-messages-from-society)

> A listener named Daisy describes her despair at being unable to have a baby

> *we get all kinds of messages from society that we need certain things in order to feel worthwhile*
> * Achievement / Success / Wealth
> * Intelligence
> * Perfection
> * Love

#### [039: Uncovering Techniques (Part 1) — The Individual Downward Arrow](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/039-uncovering-techniques-part-1-the-individual-downward-arrow)

> Cognitive Therapists believe that negative thoughts, or cognitions, can exist on two different levels. When you’re upset, you’ll have Automatic Negative Thoughts (ANTs)

> To help you pinpoint your own Self-Defeating Beliefs, David has created two uncovering techniques called the Individual Downward Arrow and the Interpersonal Downward Arrow, and Albert Ellis, the noted New York psychologist, created a third called the “What-If” Technique. 

> Once they come to the “bottom of the barrel,” they will ask you to pause the recording, and see if you can pinpoint five or six or more of Harold’s Self-Defeating Beliefs, using the list of **[23 Common Self-Defeating Beliefs](https://daviddburnsmd.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/common-self-defeating-beliefs-version-3.pdf)**.

#### [040: Uncovering Techniques (Part 2) — The Interpersonal Downward Arrow](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/040-uncovering-techniques-part-2-the-interpersonal-downward-arrow)

> Psychoanalysts sometimes help people discover what they call “core conflicts.” According to the highly regarded psychoanalytic researcher **[Lester Luborsky, PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Luborsky),** an example of a core conflict might be, “My needs will never be met in my relationships with others.” If you believe this, it will tend to function as a self-fulfilling prophecy, so you’ll constantly feel hurt, lonely, and rejected, and perhaps resentful when you try to get close to others. And you probably won’t realize you’re creating your own painful interpersonal reality. 

> David and Fabrice will illustrate a powerful, high-speed method that to bring your own Interpersonal Self-Defeating Beliefs to conscious awareness. David has called it the Interpersonal Downward Arrow Technique. David and Fabrice will revisit the same clinical example from the last Podcast—the psychologist named Harold who felt devastated when his favorite patient unexpectedly committed suicide, but in this podcast they will examine how Harold sets up his relationships with his colleagues in a way that causes him to feel lonely, anxious, and resentful.

#### [041: Uncovering Techniques (Part 3) — The What-If Technique](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/httpsdaviddburnsmdfileswordpresscom201706feeling-good-podcast-episode-41mp3)

> The third uncovering technique is called the “What-If” Technique, developed by the late Dr. Albert Ellis. The What-If Technique can will help you identify a terrifying fantasy under the surface that fuels your fears. 

#### [046: All You Need Is Love... or Do You?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/046-all-you-need-is-love-or-do-you)

> Fabrice asks David whether love is a human need? David describes hearing Dr. Aaron Beck proclaim that love is not an **adult** human need, and feeling shocked, during one of Dr. Beck’s cognitive therapy seminars in the 1970s. Although initially skeptical, David did a number of experiments to test this belief, and came to a startling conclusion. David describes the impact of needing love on his depressed and anxious patients, including lonely individuals who were constantly being rejected in the dating scene.

##### "I'm a failure. . . I'm not good enough. . . My life will be empty and meaningless without . . . "

> Several months ago I received a compelling email from a young woman named Daisy who asked about the message we get from society that lead to suffering. Fabrice and I were so inspired that we devoted an entire Feeling Good Podcast to it [(Podcast 038: Negative Messages from Society](https://feelinggood.com/2017/05/22/038-ask-david-negative-messages-from-society/))

**What’s the difference between Self-Defeating Beliefs (SDBs) vs. Cognitive Distortions?**

> The thoughts that contain cognitive distortions, such as All-or-Nothing Thinking, Overgeneralization, Discounting the Positive, and Self-Blame are distortions of reality, they are the cons that trigger depression and anxiety. 

> ...when you crush a distorted negative thought, you'll immediately feel better.

> SDBs like this cannot actually be shown to be false--they are simply your personal, subjective values, and they are thought to be with you all the time, and not just when you're depressed, anxious, or angry.

> The question with an SDB is this: What are the advantages and disadvantages of having this value system? How will it help me--what are the benefits--and how might it hurt me? What's the downside?

  > The study confirmed That both types of SBS were significantly correlated with depression severity at intake and at the 12-week evaluation. In addition, changes in depression were correlated with changes in SDBs. However, a sophisticated statistical analysis with structural equation modeling techniques did not confirm that SDBs had causal effects on depression, or that depression had causal effects on SDBs. Instead, SDBs and feelings of depression appeared to share an unknown common cause.
