#### [037: Ask David — "My negative thoughts aren't distorted!"](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/037-ask-david-my-negative-thoughts-arent-distorted)

**“My problems are real! The world really IS screwed up! And that’s not a distortion. So what can I do about my severe depression and anxiety?”**

> #1. Shari writes: 'how can we attend to our own emotional well-being in the face of genuine adversity?'
> #2. After listening to the A = Agenda Setting portion of the live therapy with Mark, Paul submitted this question:

> I am wondering what your thoughts are on how effectively the "A" step can be carried out by a patient on his/her own (i.e. without someone else verbalizing the reasons not to change / playing the part of the patient's sub-conscious)? Do you have any tips? I think I heard Mark say something to the effect that, on his own, he wouldn't have thought of all the positives that you came up with in the session.

> * Should we try to change other people's cognitive distortions, or just our own?
> * How can we challenge each of the ten cognitive distortions?
And much more!

> Fabrice asks David whether love is a human need? David describes hearing Dr. Aaron Beck proclaim that love is not an **adult** human need, and feeling shocked, during one of Dr. Beck’s cognitive therapy seminars in the 1970s. Although initially skeptical, David did a number of experiments to test this belief, and came to a startling conclusion. David describes the impact of needing love on his depressed and anxious patients, including lonely individuals who were constantly being rejected in the dating scene.

**What’s the difference between Self-Defeating Beliefs (SDBs) vs. Cognitive Distortions?**

> The thoughts that contain cognitive distortions, such as All-or-Nothing Thinking, Overgeneralization, Discounting the Positive, and Self-Blame are distortions of reality, they are the cons that trigger depression and anxiety. 

> ...when you crush a distorted negative thought, you'll immediately feel better.

> SDBs like this cannot actually be shown to be false--they are simply your personal, subjective values, and they are thought to be with you all the time, and not just when you're depressed, anxious, or angry.

> The question with an SDB is this: What are the advantages and disadvantages of having this value system? How will it help me--what are the benefits--and how might it hurt me? What's the downside?

## Research

* [Relationships between symptoms of depression and anxiety and dysfunctional beliefs about achievement and attachment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8282919). Persons, J. B., Burns, D. D., Perloff, J. M., & Miranda, J. (1993). **Journal of Abnormal Psychology**, 101(4): 518 - 524.
  > The study confirmed That both types of SBS were significantly correlated with depression severity at intake and at the 12-week evaluation. In addition, changes in depression were correlated with changes in SDBs. However, a sophisticated statistical analysis with structural equation modeling techniques did not confirm that SDBs had causal effects on depression, or that depression had causal effects on SDBs. Instead, SDBs and feelings of depression appeared to share an unknown common cause.
