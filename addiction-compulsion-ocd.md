#### [063: Ask David — What’s Good About Hopelessness or Addiction? What Is it to Be a Worthwhile Human Being?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/063-ask-david-whats-good-about-hopelessness-or-addiction-what-is-it-to-be-a-worthwhile-human-being)

* Avi asks another great question about the importance of Positive Reframing in TEAM-CBT. But how can we possibly find something positive in the feeling of hopelessness. After all, Dr. Aaron Beck has taught us that it's the worst emotion of all!
* Avi asks a similar question about an addiction. How can an addiction possibly be a good thing?
* Eugene asks a tremendous question about a passage in Dr. Burns' book, **Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy**, on the topic of what it means to be a worthwhile human being, and what it takes to make a life valuable. Eugene hints that Dr. Burns may have the wrong idea, and asks what he would say to a patient who doesn't "cry uncle!"
David and Fabrice love your questions so keep them coming!

#### [115: Healing Addiction with Stephen Pfleiderer](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/115-healing-addiction-with-stephen-pfleiderer)

> Fabrice and I were thrilled to interview our dear friend and colleague, Stephen Pfleiderer, who is the first therapist in the world using TEAM-CBT techniques in the treatment of habits and addictions, including

* life threatening addictions, like intravenous heroin or meth
* marijuana
* alcohol
* binge eating
* procrastination
* smoking
* internet porn
* and more

> Stephen begins with his personal story of excessive beer drinking starting in high school through his junior year in college when he hit a personal crisis, telling himself, "My life sucks. I can't live like this. I'm a loser." He decided to enter a 12-step recovery program, which helped tremendously, and eventually joined David's weekly TEAM training group at Stanford because of his dream of becoming a professional addiction therapist and interventionist.

#### [021: Ask David — Shameful Sexual Fantasies](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/021-ask-david-shameful-sexual-fantasies)

A listener with OCD is plagued with intrusive and shameful sexual fantasies. David discusses his treatment strategies for a young man from Argentina who was struggling with forbidden fantasies of Jesus having sex with the Virgin Mary in all positions of the Kama Sutra, but the harder he tried to control them, the more intense and tantalizing they became. Being a good Catholic lad, he was terrified and tearful he would burn in hell if he didn’t overcome this problem.

If you’ve ever struggled with shameful sexual fantasies, you might be intrigued by this fascinating discussion of **Cognitive Flooding**, therapeutic resistance, and the **Hidden Emotion Technique**!

#### [043: Ask David — The Hidden Emotion Technique for OCD](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/043-ask-david-the-hidden-emotion-technique-for-ocd)

Mon, 03 Jul 2017 05:00:00 +0000

Listeners submitted questions on OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder): 
* Is it an organic illness? 
* Are drugs necessary in the treatment? 
* What’s the best book to read if you want to heal yourself? 
* What’s the prognosis?
Drs. Nye and Burns begin by explaining OCD and answering the questions. 

> David emphasizes the importance of using four treatment models when working with OCD—the cognitive model, the motivational model, the exposure model, and the hidden emotion model if you are hoping for a rapid and complete elimination of symptoms. Treatment that focus on only one treatment method, such as exposure and response prevention, may have only limited success.

> Although years of conventional psychotherapy had failed this patient, the [**Hidden Emotion Technique**](https://feelinggood.com/2016/05/28/hidden-emotion-technique/) led to an incredible recovery in just a few minutes during a therapy session. You will find this true story inspiring and amazing! And David provides an even more amazing 40-year follow up report!

> David describes his treatment of a physician with OCD who was tortured by the fear that he would impulsively throw his newborn baby over the railing of his second-floor apartment. He also describes a psychologist with OCD who washed her hands more than 50 times a day for fear of contamination. In addition, she spent hours every day making sure that nothing in her house was arranged in groups of three—including furniture, table settings, decorative objects, magazines on tables, and so forth.

> What were the hidden emotions that fueled these obsessions and compulsions? David and Fabrice will give you the chance to pause the recording on three occasions to jot down your hypotheses before they give you the answers. It won't be important to get it "right," but it is highly desirable to take a stab at it.

> This podcast will be of interest to you if you or a loved one is struggling with OCD, or **any** form of anxiety, including phobias, panic attacks, chronic worrying, and so forth. That's because the hidden emotion phenomenon, or excessive “niceness,” may be a the root of your fears as well. Bringing those feelings to conscious awareness will often lead to sudden relief, or even a complete elimination of your symptoms.

> Then David describes his treatment of a pregnant woman with OCD who was afraid her baby would be switched at the hospital so that she’d end up with the wrong baby. Although she rationally recognized that this fear was irrational, she could not shake it from her mind, and obsessed about it constantly.

> After trying more than 30 CBT techniques that did not work, David used the What-If Technique to pinpoint her deepest fear, which turned out to be quite shocking, to say the least. He then encouraged her, with some reluctance, to confront this fear using Cognitive Flooding.

> After describing the surprising outcome, David and Fabrice discuss the fact that 75% of American therapists are afraid to use Exposure Techniques because of the fear that the patient is too fragile, or they will re-traumatize the patient. David reminds us that this is “reverse hypnosis,” where the patient hypnotizes the therapist into believing something that is not true. If the patient is successful, and the therapist agrees not to use Exposure, the prognosis for effective treatment is quite poor.

#### “Yikes! I might get contaminated!” ### The Treatment of Sara Today we are joined by a woman named Sara, who will be featured in one of the chapters from my new book, **Feeling Great**.

> You are probably aware that OCD plagued the life of the billionaire playboy, Howard Hughes, featured in the recent film, “The Aviator.” During the last years of his life, he became totally consumed by concerns about germs, and ended up isolated in the penthouse suite at the top of a hotel in Las Vegas. According to a [“psychological autopsy”](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes) published by the American Psychological Association, Hughes lay naked in bed in darkened hotel rooms in what he considered a germ-free zone. He even wore tissue boxes on his feet to protect them, and burned his clothing if someone near him became ill.

> Sara, today’s guest, was a victim of the same type of OCD. She describes how her intense fears of germs and contamination came on more than 20 years ago, and the devastating impact of the OCD on her as well as her relationships with friends and family. She also describes her shame about her rituals of constantly washing her hands and desperately trying to avoid contamination.
