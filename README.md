### Tools Not Schools of Psychotherapy

* [What’s the Best School of Psychotherapy?](https://feelinggood.com/2017/03/08/4069/)
  > All of the therapies appeared to be more effective than no therapy at all, and nearly all of the studies reported fairly significant gains for depressed patients, with one or another brand of therapy being identified as “the best.” But what was confusing was that each study seemed to identify a different brand of psychotherapy as the winner. Some researchers reported that cognitive therapy was the most effective treatment, while other researchers that psychodynamic therapy, behavior therapy worked the best, and so forth.
  > 
  > Then the researchers identified the school of therapy that the researchers felt allegiance to, and controlled for this potential source of bias in the statistical analyses. Now the results looked radically different—there were no differences at all between the different types of psychotherapy. They all performed about the same, and none performed in a really stellar way.
  > 
  > The researchers concluded that the outcome literature is heavily biased by the researchers who conduct the research, and proposed that we might be better off studying how psychotherapy works rather than trying to investigate which brand is the most effective, so that a new science of psychotherapy can evolve and replace the schools of therapy that currently compete with each other.

* [TEAM vs CBT](https://feelinggood.com/team-vs-cbt/)
  > I am very proud to have contributed to the birth and evolution of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which was one of the most important developments of 20th century psychiatry and psychology. When I first wrote my first book, Feeling Good, CBT was practically unknown. Now it has become one of the most widely practiced and researched forms of psychotherapy throughout the world. Aaron Beck, MD, Albert Ellis, PhD, and a host of other brilliant pioneers helped to create CBT, and we owe all of them an enormous debt of gratitude.
* [047: Tools, Not Schools, of Therapy](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/047-tools-not-schools-of-therapy)
  > The title of David's TEAM-CBT eBook for therapists is [Tools, Not Schools, of Therapy](https://daviddburnsmd.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/aaa-ebook-order-form-for-website-v-1.pdf). David explains that the field of psychotherapy is dominated by numerous schools of therapy that compete like religions, or even cults, each claiming to have the answer to emotional suffering. So you’ve got the psychodynamic school, and the psychoanalytic school, the Adlerian school, the Beckian cognitive therapy school, the Jungian school, and tons more, including EMDR, behavior therapy, humanistic therapy, ACT, TMT, EMT, and so forth.
  > 
  > David argues that the fields needs to move from competing schools of therapy to a new, science-based, data-driven psychotherapy.
