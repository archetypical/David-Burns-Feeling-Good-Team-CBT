# David Burns | Feeling Good | TEAM-CBT

A curated list of David Burns' contribution to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and beyond.

At the moment, in each of these files are links to Feeling Good podcast episodes organized by topic.

Simply listening has been transformative, already. I am so grateful for Dr. Burns' work, have a few of his books on order. I see a world-changing potential in these techniques, along with [Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication](https://gitlab.com/prosocial-dynamic/nvc-rosenberg).

The initial idea of this project is to make a high-level map of Dr. Burns' TEAM therapy. 

I'd also like to make an index of related research and history, including the works of [Albert Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis), and [Aaron T Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_T._Beck).

There are a number of directions to go from there, like working on a set of universal human fears and anxieties, cognitive distorties, negative thoughts, etc.

    > I am very proud to have contributed to the birth and evolution of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which was one of the most important developments of 20th century psychiatry and psychology. When I first wrote my first book, Feeling Good, CBT was practically unknown. Now it has become one of the most widely practiced and researched forms of psychotherapy throughout the world. Aaron Beck, MD, Albert Ellis, PhD, and a host of other brilliant pioneers helped to create CBT, and we owe all of them an enormous debt of gratitude.

## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

* [What is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)?](https://beckinstitute.org/get-informed/what-is-cognitive-therapy/) - Beck Institute
  > Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapy that has been shown to be effective in over 2,000 research studies. It is a time-sensitive, structured, present-oriented psychotherapy that helps individuals identify goals that are most important to them and overcome obstacles that get in the way. CBT helps people get better and stay better.

  > From my research work, I was getting the idea that patients— depressed patients—had a negative representation of the self, as indicated in the dreams. Then I saw that they were having cognitive distortions. I got the notion that people had negative beliefs, and the negative beliefs would act as a kind of prism and would block out positive things and only allow in negative things. It was also a warped prism, so the interpretations that people would make of what was going on were distorted. 
  > 
  > Now we have the representations and we have the distortions, and then the question is, “What do you do about it?” At that particular time, I became aware of the work of Albert Ellis. Ellis had actually come before me in terms of seeing a relationship between people’s thinking and their affect, or their thinking and their behavior. He had already written a book on this, and he had developed a therapy that he called rational emotive therapy. 
  > 
  > I borrowed some of his thoughts—some of Ellis’s techniques—and I had people now start to examine their thinking, not challenge it, which was Ellis’s term, but to start to explore, investigate, evaluate their automatic thoughts. We would do this in a variety of ways. One is: If a person had a negative thought such as, “My wife doesn’t love me because she ran off without saying goodbye,” we’d say, “First of all, is this the only time she’s done this, or does she do this a lot? That’s selective abstraction. Are you making some general statement? This is overgeneralization,” and so on. Then we’d say, “Now, is there some alternative explanation? Does it logically follow that the reason she went off is because she didn’t care for you?”—a whole variety of techniques. 
  > 
  > What happened, and this was my next surprise, was when I started to have people look at their automatic thoughts, they started to get better. While I could have patients doing analytic therapy with me for two or three years, after about 10 or 12 sessions the patient would say, “Well, doctor, you’ve helped me a lot. Bye-bye.” My caseload shrunk, and pretty soon I was down to very few patients.

> The theory of CT was influenced by Greek Stoic philosophers and by a number of contemporary theorists such as Adler, Alexander, Horney, Sullivan, Kelly, Arnold, Ellis, Lazarus, Bandura, Lewinsohn, and Meichenbaum. Breaking with psychoanalytic models of theory and practice, Beck incorporated behavioral approaches as espoused by social learning, stress inoculation training, problem solving training, and self‐control therapy, with a primary emphasis on changing cognition as well as behavior.

## Albert Ellis

[Bibliography](http://albertellis.org/albert-ellis-bibliography-page-1/)
[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis#Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy_(REBT))
> From the late 1940s onwards, Ellis worked on rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), and by January 1953 his break with psychoanalysis was complete, and he began calling himself a rational therapist. Ellis was now advocating a new more active and directive type of psychotherapy. In 1955, he presented rational therapy (RT). In RT, the therapist sought to help the client understand—and act on the understanding—that his personal philosophy contained beliefs that contributed to his own emotional pain. This new approach stressed actively working to change a client's self-defeating beliefs and behaviours by demonstrating their irrationality, self-defeatism and rigidity. Ellis believed that through rational analysis and cognitive reconstruction, people could understand their self-defeatingness in light of their core irrational beliefs and then develop more rational constructs.
> 
> In 1954, Ellis began teaching his new techniques to other therapists, and by 1957, he formally set forth the first cognitive behavioral therapy by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as the treatment for emotional and behavioral problems. Two years later, Ellis published How to Live with a Neurotic, which elaborated on his new method.

> A. (Activating situation) I tried to do something and failed
> B. (Irrational Belief I have about A) I must always be successful
> C. (Consequences of believing B) I feel bad, depressed, etc
> D. (Dispute the Irrational Belief in B) where is it written in stone that I must I always be successful?
> E. (Effective new thinking to replace B) I would prefer always to be successful but let’s be realistic- that isn’t very likely, is it- so when I’m not successful I don’t need to make myself feel bad.
