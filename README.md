> **In your Feeling Good Handbook**, you suggest that the reader just allows himself or herself to be an ordinary person instead of trying to be perfect. Contrary to your opinion in the book, you're an outstanding therapist in reality. You’ve studied in one of the world’s top colleges, you’re well-educated with a doctor degree, and successful in your career and life. How can I believe your claim? I'm quite confused!

### [018: Ask David — Overcoming the Fear of Death](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/018-ask-david-overcoming-the-fear-of-death)

> Existential Therapists believe that the fear of death is universal and is at the root of most emotional problems. Dr. Burns argues that the fear of death is actually quite rare, but does occasionally occur and is extremely treatable. In this podcast, David’s describes his quick, three-part “cure” for the fear of death.
 
> Oddly, every patient he treated in this way insisted at the end of the session that it didn’t help. And even stranger is the fact that 100% of them returned the next week and announced that they actually had been cured and were, in fact, no longer afraid of death!

### [021: Ask David — Shameful Sexual Fantasies](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/021-ask-david-shameful-sexual-fantasies)

A listener with OCD is plagued with intrusive and shameful sexual fantasies. David discusses his treatment strategies for a young man from Argentina who was struggling with forbidden fantasies of Jesus having sex with the Virgin Mary in all positions of the Kama Sutra, but the harder he tried to control them, the more intense and tantalizing they became. Being a good Catholic lad, he was terrified and tearful he would burn in hell if he didn’t overcome this problem.

If you’ve ever struggled with shameful sexual fantasies, you might be intrigued by this fascinating discussion of **Cognitive Flooding**, therapeutic resistance, and the **Hidden Emotion Technique**!

### [036: Ask David — Empowering the Victim With the Five Secrets](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/036-ask-david-empowering-the-victim-with-the-five-secrets)

A blog reader made a fairly strong and impassioned comment that sometimes asking the patient to examine ways she or he may be contributing to the problem may be a mistake when the patient really IS a victim, and cautioned against blaming the victim. David’s goal is never to blame patients, but rather to empower you.
David and Fabrice begin by discussing the fact that sometimes people vacillate between other-blame (it’s all his/her fault) and self-blame (it’s all my fault), and emphasize that neither approach is helpful. If you blame the other person, the problem escalates and may turn to violence, but if, instead, you blame yourself, you’ll probably end up feeling worthless, guilty, unlovable, and depressed.

So what’s the solution to this dilemma? Dr. Burns encourages patients to use the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://daviddburnsmd.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf) and make a radical change in the way they communicate with others, along the lines of EAR. E stands for Empathy, A stands for Assertiveness, and R stands for Respect.

David gives five compelling examples of how to deal with people who REALLY ARE violent and abuse, including a raging psychiatric patient who was threatening the staff and on the verge of exploding, a serial killer who kidnapped a social worker who had attended one of David’s communication workshops, some drunken, abusive teenagers in a huge jeep who threatened David, an insulting, demoralizing, critical boss who put down everyone who worked with him. He includes with the story of a Lutheran minister,  Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was imprisoned and mistreated by the Nazis during world war two.

### [053: Ask David — “I don’t feel like doing it!” Quick Cure for Procrastinators](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/053-ask-david-i-dont-feel-like-doing-it-quick-cure-for-procrastinators)

A listener named Benjamin asks about procrastination. He wrote:

“The live therapy with Marilyn was very interesting - like other listeners, I was impressed by her character and strength.

“Towards the end of this most recent podcast, you were musing on what topics to cover in future podcasts. I would love to hear about how you treat people suffering from chronic laziness ("Do Nothingism"). In particular, there seems to be a strong potential of a Catch-22 with Process Resistance: The patient cannot find the motivation to do anything, yet they have to carry out the process (do the homework) to improve.

“Even worse, in "Feeling Good", you categorize "Do Nothingism" into around 10 different categories, and suggest a different approach for each one. What should a lazy person do, who identifies with multiple categories, but is already starting to feel overwhelmed at the prospect of doing one of those activities, let alone five of them?

“I would love to hear David's thoughts on this!”

David and Fabrice begin by thanking Benjamin, and David emphasizes how helpful and inspiring it is to receive specific questions like this, which makes it easy to create a (hopefully) informative and interesting podcast.

David says that his thinking about the treatment of procrastination has changed greatly since he wrote **Feeling Good**. One big change is that he no longer tries to “help” individuals who procrastinate, since this will cause them to continue to procrastinate, and the failure will now be the failure of the therapist, who’s “helping” wasn’t good enough.

Instead, David outlines a multi-step approach, based on someone who has ten years of unfiled papers that have piled up in his office, so that by now 15 feet of desk space is completely covered by piles of papers roughly one foot high. Fabrice plays the role of the resistant patient, and David plays the role of the therapist.

The steps include:

**Paradoxical Agenda Setting:** David asks, “The procrastination seems to be working for you. Why would you want to change? Let’s make a list of all the benefits of procrastination, and all the reasons NOT to change.” David emphasizes that the patient has to convince the therapist that this is something he really **does** want to change. It’s NOT the therapist’s role to help or to convince the patient to change!

**Miracle Cure Question:** What kind of help would you like in today’s session? Most patients say they need help with motivation. David declines to offer this, explaining that it isn’t on the therapeutic menu today—only the “Blue Plate Special!” The patient must agree to begin working on the filing in spite of having no motivation.

David also explains the underlying concept behind this strategy: most procrastinators are waiting for motivation, but that never works. You’ll be waiting forever, because you’re NEVER going to feel like doing all that filing! You aren’t entitled to motivation!

Productive individuals know that action comes first, and motivation comes second.

**Specificity:** What time would you like my help in overcoming your procrastination? The patient’s requests for help yesterday or tomorrow are declined by the therapist, so they settle on 6 PM today.

**Little Steps for Big Feats:** Let’s list the first five things you would need to do tonight at 6 PM, making sure that every step can be completed in 15 to 30 seconds. They list these steps:


* Walk into my office
* Choose one pile to start working on
* Pick up the top piece of paper on the pile
* Put it into a blank manila file folder
* Label the file folder

**Let’s Be Specific:** David asks if Fabrice needs help with Step 1? Step 2? Etc. Fabrice finally admits he can do these five steps.

**Five Minute Rule:** David asks if Fabrice will agree to do these five steps between 6 PM and 6:05 PM, and if he will agree to work on his filing for ONLY those five minutes. At the end of the five minutes he has completed 100% of the assignment. The rationale is that if Fabrice tries to do it all, he’ll get so overwhelmed that he won’t do anything. But if he agrees to ONLY five minutes, that will be do-able. And if he surprises himself, and gets motivated to do more, he can, be he only gets credit for the first five minutes.

**Problem – Solution List:** David asks Fabrice to put a line down the middle of a piece of paper, from top to bottom, and list all the problems that will get in the way at 6 PM, and then to list convincing solutions to each problem in the right-hand column. Fabrice lists two problems: 1. I won’t feel like it. And 2. Traffic might be heavy, so I might not get home by 6 PM.

**“I Stubbornly Refused” Technique:** David asks Fabrice to agree to an unusual phone call at 6:05 PM!

**TIC – TOC Technique:** David plays the role of Fabrice’s “Task-Interfering Cognitions” (TICS) that will tempt him to procrastinate, and asks Fabrice to play the role of the “Task-Oriented Cognitions” (TOCS) he can use to combat the TOCs. The TICS include the familiar ones such as:

* Five minutes won’t help, the job is overwhelming.
* Even if I get started, I’ll just relapse, so there will never be a permanent solution.
* It’s not such a big problem, I don’t need to do my filing now.
* I can watch Game of Thrones on TV instead. That will be more fun.
* It will be too anxiety provoking to get started.
* It’s too late to get started anyway.
* Tomorrow will be a better day.

David confesses the problem is one that he actually had, and describes how he solved it, using this exact approach!

### [061: Ask David — Test Validity, Uncovering the Negative Thoughts, Benefits of Laziness, and More...](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/061-ask-david-test-validity-uncovering-the-negative-thoughts-benefits-of-laziness-and-more)

We address a number of excellent questions submitted by listeners:

* Are the scales on your Brief Mood Survey reliable and valid?
* How can I identify my Negative Thoughts when I'm upset but I can’t figure out what I'm thinking and telling myself?
* I have social anxiety and don’t want to get out of bed. I'd rather just lie in bed and watch Game of Thrones. Help me! What should I do?
* I saw an article in the paper that claimed that bacteria in the gut cause anxiety. Is this true? If not, what **does** cause depression and anxiety?
* Could your tools, like the Cost-Benefit Analysis, help with problems that aren’t necessarily emotional problems? Like what career to pursue, or what college to go to?
* What should you do if you feel great at the end of a therapy session, and then become severely upset again during the week?
* How does Dr. Burns deal with resistance from colleagues when he is trying to teach these new TEAM-CBT techniques? Does he run into much resistance? How does he feel about the resistance?

### [072: Secrets of Weight Loss — Make Good on Your New Year's Resolutions!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/072-secrets-of-weight-loss-make-good-on-your-new-years-resolutions)

You definitely do NOT want to lose weight. You probably DO want to be thin and attractive, and in great physical condition, but you DON'T want to lose weight. Do you know why? There are only two things that you can do to lose weight--diet and exercise. And they both suck!

David describes two new, powerful techniques he has created for resolving this dilemma--the Double Paradox and Devil's Advocate Technique. David and Fabrice bring these techniques to life for you. If you are interested in losing weight, make sure you do the two exercises on paper while listening to this podcast.

### [080: Ask David — Where Do Negative Thoughts Come From?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/080-ask-david-where-do-negative-thoughts-come-from)

In this podcast, David and Fabrice answer several fascinating questions submitted by listeners:

* Jackie asks where our distorted thoughts come from, since they are so often irrational and distorted, and inconsistent with the facts. Why do we sometimes beat up on ourselves relentlessly with negative thoughts?
* Tyler asks if it possible to do TEAM-CBT in conventional, 45 minute sessions. And if so, how? It seems my patients are just warming up by the end of the session, and then we have to start all over again the next week.
* Jess asks if it is possible to use the Five Secrets of Effective Communication in non-therapy settings. For example, if you are in a position of authority, like a high school teacher, will your students lose respect for you if you use the Five Secrets? Could you use the Five Secrets if you are working with violent gang members?

* Courtney asks how to find the supplemental written materials, tests, and diagrams if you have purchased the eBook or audio-book copy of **Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy**.
* Carlos asks about the best treatment for smoking cessation. During the discussion, Fabrice asks if Paradoxical Agenda Setting is important for therapists using hypnotherapy.
* Avi asks whether humans have a dark side, with dark negative motives that sometimes compete with positive, loving motives. And if so, how do therapists help patients deal with their own negative motives?
* Ben asks what to do if you're very anxious but simply can't pinpoint your negative thoughts.

## [089: Ask David — Anxiety Triggers, Weaning off Anti-Depressants](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/089-ask-david-anxiety-triggers-weaning-off-anti-depressants)

David and Fabrice answer five intriguing questions submitted by listeners:

* Joshua: How can I cope with panic attacks during job interviews?
* Dan: I feel traumatized by criticisms from my boss at work. what can I do?
* Susan: How fast can you taper off of anti-anxiety drugs and antidepressants?

* Sumit: I think I have "endogenous depression." Can TEAM-CBT help me? Or will I have to rely on medications? What is endogenous depression?

If you have a question, make sure you email david and we will try to answer your question on an upcoming Ask David Podcast!

### [103: Ask David — Dealing with Intrusive Memories, Is Depression Inherited?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/103-ask-david-dealing-with-intrusive-memories-is-depression-inherited)

Today we answer six questions submitted by listeners like you:

* Harald: How can I find the Show Notes for the Feeling Good Podcasts?
* Kristin: How do you help patients who obsess about past traumatic events, with intrusive thoughts about a cruel ex-lover or bullying by classmates? These thoughts can feed into the idea that their life is miserable and  they can’t move forward because they feel blocked by these harmful memories.
* Valentina: How are cognitive distortions, self-defeating beliefs, and feelings of depression transmitted? What you describe in your books seems to describe my mother’s behaviors when I was growing up? Could it be that depression is transmitted by the family?
* Alicia: How would you treat someone with cyclothymic disorder who cycles between euphoria and suicidal depression? He’s happy now, so how do I get him to fill out the Daily Mood Log?
* Kathy: I’m a big fan, and I have a question about “bibliotherapy.” What’s the best way to use your books and other materials to help yourself?
* Matthew: Do you ever use drugs in the treatment of depression? Are medications sometimes necessary or helpful?

### [104: Ask David — The Treatment of Acute and Chronic Pain](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/104-ask-david-the-treatment-of-acute-and-chronic-pain)

David describes research on the relationship between physical pain and negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, and anger. Does pain cause depression? Or does depression cause or amplify pain?

And what can we do to help patients with physical pain and intense negative emotions?

In addition, why do so many individuals struggle with somatic problems, such as physical pain, dizziness, or fatigue, when there is no apparent organic cause for the pain? Is there any hope?

### [105: Ask Dr. Helen (and David) — Is There Such a Thing as Empathy Fatigue?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/105-ask-dr-helen-and-david-is-there-such-a-thing-as-empathy-fatigue)

We have invited Dr. Helen Yeni-Komshian to join Fabrice and me for two consecutive podcasts on questions listeners have asked about troubled relationships. In today's podcast, we address a question from Mary about how to deal with a husband who constantly complains and exaggerates how awful things are at work, in politics, and in the world. But when Mary tries to dismiss his statements in an effort to "keep the peace," it just gets worse. His complaints escalate!

This is a common problem and you may have run into it as well. Do you have a friend or family member who loves to complain? And have you noticed that your attempts to help or point out the irrationality of his or her complaints are futile? So what SHOULD you do? What's the secret of dealing with a whiner or a complainer? Is it even possible.

Helen and David provide a myriad of information and describe techniques such as Forced Empathy, Interpersonal Decision Making, Changing the Focus, and the Five Secrets of Effective Communication. You'll LOVE this lively dialogue!

### [108: Do You Have a "Self?"](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/108-do-you-have-a-self)

David emphasizes that there are two issues. First, can your “self” be validly judged as not good enough, as inferior or even worthless? Or, can your “self” be validly judged as more worthwhile, or even superior? And is it really true that some people are more worthwhile, or less worthwhile, than others? Do more worthwhile, or less worthwhile human beings exist?

Second, do we even have a “self?”

Fabrice talks about the history of the concept of ego. For example, Freud divided the human mind into three parts: the id, ego and superego. Do these really exist as “things,” or are they just concepts, or metaphors for talking about the mind? When you try to think about the “ego” or the “self” as a thing, that’s when you get in trouble.

David argues that if you believe that someone people are “more worthwhile” or “less worthwhile,” you’d have to define what a of worthwhile human being is.

### [110: Ask David — How do You Deal with a Sociopath?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/110-ask-david-how-do-you-deal-with-a-sociopath)

* **Richard: **Do you have to get along with **everybody**? How do you deal with a sociopath?
* **Dave:** Positive distortions can trigger mania, addictions, narcissism, and violence--but how can you get rid of them?
* **Julia:** What can you do if you've been depressed all of your life and wake up every morning with your mind flooded with negative thoughts? I spend two hours trying to dispute them, but they just keep coming back the next day.
* **Omhur:** How would you treat "Reading OCD?" I feel compelled to read every sentence and paragraph carefully and repeatedly so I won't miss anything!
* **Unnamed fan** (who left a negative review on iTunes): Isn't your concept of the death of the ego potentially dangerous to people with low self-esteem who are being abused?

### [113: Ask David — How Can I Overcome My Perfectionism?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/113-ask-david-how-can-i-overcome-my-perfectionism)

1. Steven asks about the best route to take if you want to learn and practice TEAM-CBT? Is the degree important? What's the best degree? Should you go to school to become a psychologist,  clinical social worker, addiction counselor, psychiatrist, professional counselor, pastoral counselor, marriage and family therapist, life coach, or what? There are so many degrees and potential paths that my head is spinning!
2. Sandy asks how to overcome long-standing, entrenched perfectionistic tendencies.
3. Rin asks about the Burns Depression checklist and the criteria for depression in the DSM. He is (understandably) confused about the so-called "somatic" symptoms of depression, like insomnia or changes in appetite.
4. Kevin is a therapist with a simple question: How do I get over my desire to help?
5. Amanda asks how to use the Disarming Technique with a patient who thinks he or she isn’t making any progress in the therapy.


### [121: Ask David — Do You Believe in Freud's Notion of Secondary Gain? Is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) Real?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/121-ask-david-do-you-believe-in-freuds-notion-of-secondary-gain-is-seasonal-affective-disorder-sad-real)

### Answers to Great Questions from Listeners Like YOU! 

* **Dylan asks:** Do you believe in Freud’s “secondary gain,” in which patients resist change because they benefit from their symptoms?
* **Juleann asks:** Is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) a real thing?
* **Ismail asks:** Should I use the Daily Mood Log just when I’m upset, or at the end of the day, or when? Do I have to stop what I’m doing when I get negative thoughts so I can write them down and work on them?
* **Abe asks:** What about negative thoughts that are valid? For example, I was interested in astronomy and physics as a teenager, but my SAT scores showed I had no aptitude for a career in these areas.
* **Kevin asks:** Can positive flooding be used to change the object of our desires—for example, our sexual desires, like the man in one of your books who had lost sexual interest in his wife?
* **Valentina asks:** Where do cognitive distortions come from? Our parents? Our genes? Societal messages?

### [125: Ask David — How Do You Treat Chronic Laziness?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/125-ask-david-how-do-you-treat-chronic-laziness)

### More Great Questions from Listeners 

* **Kevin asks:** After your initial improvement from treatment or from reading your book, Feeling Good, what can one do moving forward to give yourself “booster shots?”
* **Umatsagir asks a related question:** I feel great right after reading your book, Feeling Good, but the effect diminishes over time. What should I do?
* **Umatsagir also asks:** Is there an anxiety masterpiece equivalent of your book, Feeling Good?
* **Kyle asks:** What can I do, as a therapist, about the passive patient who just shrugs when I ask what he wants to work on, and says, “My Mom thinks I should come to see you.” When I try to dig deeper to try to find out what patients like this want help with, I run into resistance and then they typically drop out of therapy. What should I do?
* **Benjamin asks a somewhat related question:** How do you treat chronic laziness? In your book, Feeling Good, you call this “Do-Nothingism,” which is a lack of motivation that you often see in depression. In your book, you talk about ten different types of procrastination, with a different approach for each. If the patient feels overwhelmed by many things he or she is procrastinating on, how can you help that person, since he or she probably can’t do the psychotherapy homework, either! It’s a Catch-22, since they cannot find the motivation to do anything, but have to do the homework to improve!
* **Jim asks another related question:** How about doing a podcast on psychotherapy homework? “What do you have your patients do for homework? This is particularly important since I have 45 minute sessions and can only see my patients for 45 minutes every two or three weeks.”

**Mark asks:** How can I help a depressed family member or friend who is passive and doesn’t want to do anything?
**Paul asks:** How can I get over death anxiety?
**Sune asks:** If you're super-shy, does this mean you have “Avoidant Personality Disorder?” What's the difference between garden variety shyness and a personality disorder?
**Sly asks:** “Do you believe in the big five personality traits model? And will your therapy tools change these big five traits? I got a score of 67 on neuroticism, which means I am more prone to anger, depression, anxiety, and vulnerability, and tend to think about things in a pessimistic way. If I do the exercises in your books, and develop a more realistic outlook on myself and others, does it follow that my “personality traits” will get more or less changed?”

According to Wikipedia, the “Big Five” are often represented by the acronym, **OCEAN.** 
O = [Openness to experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience), 
C = [Conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness), 
E = [Extraversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion), 
A = [Agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness), and 
N = [Neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism)

Here's an important point I forgot to make on the podcast. According to Wikipedia, here's the definition of "[Neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism):" 

People with high neuroticism indexes are at risk for the development and onset of common [mental disorders. . .](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder), [mood disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorders), [anxiety disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder), and [substance use disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder), symptoms of which had traditionally been called [Neurosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis)."

> Can you see that this is a tautology? In other words, they ask you if you tend to have these kinds of symptoms, then they tell you this is "due to" some "trait" you have called "neuroticism." But they are defining "neuroticism" as people who tend to have more of these kinds of symptoms! It's circular reasoning. 
> 
> I hope you can "see" this! The reason I mention this is they make it sound like they discovered some "trait" you have which causes you to have depression, or anxiety, and so forth. But they haven't! It's just a word game. In fact, scientists don't yet know the causes of any of these problems, and "traits" do not actually "exist." 

**Haike asks:** What if you’ve battled your negative thoughts and self-defeating beliefs and still don’t feel happy? An absence of depression and anxiety does not necessarily mean more joy in life. How can you help people find out where they want to go in life, who they want to be, and what it is that brings them happiness?”

* Do we REALLY create our own interpersonal reality? What if you’re being raped? Are you saying that’s your fault? How can that be?
* I struggle with anxiety. Why is it a mistake to try to “calm down?”
* How do you deal with entitlement? I think my patients should do what I tell them to do! After all, I’m a highly trained professional!
* How do you deal with racism, sexism, and other societal barriers? What if the injustice is **real** and it isn’t “all in your head?”

### [146: When Helping Doesn't Help!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/146-when-helping-doesnt-help)

> Most people do not do a very good at helping loved ones, colleagues, or friends who are upset and complaining. Have you ever noticed that when you try to help or give advice they just keep complaining? This can be very frustrating--fortunately there's a fabulous solution to this universal problem. 

Rhonda, Jill, and I discussed the most common errors we all make when we lose patience with someone who's complaining, and illustrated the techniques that are effective. As usual, they involve the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf), especially Disarming, Stroking, and Feeling Empathy, along with some compassionate I Feel Statements.

> We also discussed a closely related and possibly controversial theme--is it okay to use the Five Secrets just to get someone to stop complaining, especially if you're angry with that person and they tend to complain most or all of the time? Do you always have to use the Five Secrets in a totally sincere manner?

#### Is it REALLY Possible? And Can the Effects Last? 

Mon, 01 Jul 2019 08:00:00 +0000

> Rhonda and David interview Garry, a veteran who David treated for PTSD several years ago at a trauma workshop in Michigan. Garry describes how a repressed horrific memory from his childhood suddenly and forcefully re-emerged when he smelled some Queen Anne’s Lace that were in blossom. 

> He suddenly remembered how a school bus he was riding home on hit a horse with a boy, Tommy, who was riding bareback, when the horse suddenly lurched in front of the bus. Tommy was Gary’s classmate.
> 
> The bus driver said, “Don’t look!” But Garry watched as his friend, who was trapped under the dead horse, “bled out” and died.
> 
> Once this totally forgotten memory re-emerged decades later, roughly 18 months prior to Garry’s session with David, it constantly intruded into Garry’s every interaction for the next year and a half. Garry says,
> 
> “I was seeing Tommy all the time, and having symptoms of anxiety, intrusive memory and dissociation experiences. I would often see the image of Tommy lying on the pavement superimposed over conversations I was happened with people in an intimate way. It was quite disturbing and anxiety provoking.”

> Can severe PTSD be treated in a single therapy session? Did Garry **really** improve? Were the changes real? Did they last? And how did the therapy work?

* **Vipul:** Tell us about your new book, Feeling Great. How will it be different from Feeling Good? And can people with schizoaffective disorder be helped? (story with Stirling Moorey)
* **Guy:** What’s a nervous breakdown?
* **Rob:** How would you treat a field goal kicker who’s afraid of missing the winning field goal? Would you use positive visualizations?
* **Michael:** How would you treat someone with the fear of aging? I turn 60 in a few months, and have been experiencing anxiety around not be able to do some of the things I love as I age.
* **Hidem:** How fast is fast? I notice your frequent use of the term "High Speed Recovery" (and even Warp Speed) when describing the benefits of TEAM CBT. How rapidly does the average patient recover?
* **Brittany:** I had an idea that I think would benefit a lot of us. I’d like you to do a podcast on a week or a day in your life. The ups & downs of your moods, triggers, etc., & most importantly how you deal with them. Do you write out your own Negative Thoughts a Daily Mood Log?
Thank you for all of your great questions, comments, and testimonials! Rhonda and I really appreciate that!

Mon, 12 Aug 2019 08:00:00 +0000

* **Kelly** asks**:** Would love to hear a podcast about to use or not to use touch in therapy. I personally feel touch is extremely helpful (what is more natural than to hug or put a hand on someone hurting), however I believe our profession has become so “professionalized” that is leaves out such a power act of healing. Did you ever use touch when you were practicing, and do you feel it is appropriate?
* **Against Machines Taking Over** asks: You say that depression always results from distorted thoughts. But the sadness that results from a failure, rejection, or disappointment is not distorted. Can you explain a bit more about this?
* **Against Machines Taking Over** also asks: Is there something you used to advocate for before but then you changed your mind?
* **Eduardo** asks: How do you treat hypochondriasis. Almost all articles and advices I've read for hypochondriasis try to cover the writer's back by first and foremost telling you that you should get yourself checked for real causes for your concern.
* **Eduardo** also asks: I've been struggling with anxiety, and after reading When Panic Attacks, I got very interested in giving The Hidden Emotion model a try, but it seems to be structure-less. It seems to require a lot of detective work with no clear sheet or procedure. It's just Detective Work, and then do something about it. Is there some newer technique to dig into what's eating you?

Mon, 26 Aug 2019 08:00:00 +0000

**The Story of Lorraine and “Anna”**

> In today’s podcast, David and Rhonda interview Dr. Lorraine Wong, a board-certified clinical psychologist, and her patient, “Anna,” who sought treatment recently for depression, anxiety, and self-image / self-esteem issues. But first, David and Rhonda answer a question submitted by Estafonia, a “public image consultant,” who asks about the treatment of a woman who sees herself as “fat.”

> Lorraine, Rhonda, David and Anna quickly diagnose the most likely cause of Estefania’s stuckness—she is trying to “help” her patient without first melting away her patient’s resistance. This is the cause of practically all therapeutic failure, and you’re not really doing TEAM-CBT if you don’t know how to eliminate the patient’s resistance.

> Once Estafonia and her patient list all these positives, Estafonia could ask her patient, “Given all these advantages and positive qualities, maybe it wouldn’t be such a good idea to stop telling yourself, ‘I’m fat.’ This thought seems to be working for you in a really positive way, and also reflects your core values.”

> That’s the essence of Paradoxical Agenda Setting. We try, in a genuine way, to honor the patient’s resistance, rather than trying to sell the patient on change. This is very difficult for therapists to learn because of the compulsion to save, help, or rescue the patient.

> Anna and Lorraine explain why the T = Testing and E = Empathy of TEAM were so critical to the success of the therapy. Anna says that Lorraine was, in fact, the first therapist “who **really** got me, and **really** understood me!”

> Anna emphasizes the enormous importance of the A = Paradoxical Agenda Setting (aka Assessment of Resistance) as well. Lorraine helped Anna discover what was beautiful and awesome about all of her negative feelings, including severe depression, shame, anxiety, anger, loneliness, and even hopelessness. 

> The Positive Reframing proved to be a positive shock to the system, and Anna’s symptoms started to improve significantly even before starting the M = Methods phase of the TEAM-CBT treatment.

> Lorraine used David’s “Devil’s Advocate Technique,” to help Anna challenge the tempting thoughts that always triggered her overeating.

> [Dr. Lorraine Wong](http://www.drlorrainewong.com) is a certified Level 4 TEAM-CBT therapist and practices at the Feeling Good Institute in Mountain View, California. She specializes in the treatment of body image concerns and emotional eating, as well as depression and anxiety, with TEAM-CBT.

Mon, 02 Sep 2019 08:00:00 +0000

> **Ann** asks: Loved your podcast (on the exposure model, #26)! I have suffered from panic attacks for years - the past 2 years I've become agoraphobic and don't want to be far away from my house. So, my phobia is now "having panic attacks." Does that mean I just need to go out and have a bunch of panic attacks in public to get over my fear? The thought seems terrifying.

> **Nathan** asks: In your podcasts you mention that you conducted a "study on the psychiatric inpatient unit at the Stanford Hospital, in which I evaluated how accurate therapists’ perceptions of patients were after an interaction."

> I was wondering if you could provide me with a reference to this study? 

> **Richard** asks: I listened to your podcast on being worthwhile and found it interesting. You say all people are worthwhile. This may be true but does the whole world think this?

> If a person is worthwhile but the world thinks they are not worthwhile, isn't this almost as bad as not actually being worthwhile. Don't we have to play by the world’s rules, however bad, instead of our own or the Platonic rules? What do you think?

> **Robert** asks: I have never heard you mention Tom Szasz, who, as I am sure you know, was making some of the same observations about the constructs of medicalizing you make back in the 1960s and maybe even in the 50s.

> In particular, his criticism of the psychiatric industry giving the names of diseases or syndromes to behavioral issues was very consistent with yours.

> **Robert** also asks: My other question is an idea for future podcasts and it is...How about critiquing the therapeutic approach we see so often on television and in the movies?

> Some of the Hollywood therapists people know best are:

* Judd Hirsch as the shrink in Ordinary People
* Lorraine Bracco as the shrink in The Sopranos
* Peter Bogdanovich as the shrink's shrink in The Sopranos
* Billy Crystal as the shrink in Analyze This!
* Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting
* Kelsey Grammer in Frasier
I am sure there are many others. These are the ones who quickly came to mind

### “Yikes! I might get contaminated!” ### The Treatment of Sara Today we are joined by a woman named Sara, who will be featured in one of the chapters from my new book, **Feeling Great**.

> You are probably aware that OCD plagued the life of the billionaire playboy, Howard Hughes, featured in the recent film, “The Aviator.” During the last years of his life, he became totally consumed by concerns about germs, and ended up isolated in the penthouse suite at the top of a hotel in Las Vegas. According to a “psychological autopsy” ([https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes)) published by the American Psychological Association, Hughes lay naked in bed in darkened hotel rooms in what he considered a germ-free zone. He even wore tissue boxes on his feet to protect them, and burned his clothing if someone near him became ill.

Sara, today’s guest, was a victim of the same type of OCD. She describes how her intense fears of germs and contamination came on more than 20 years ago, and the devastating impact of the OCD on her as well as her relationships with friends and family. She also describes her shame about her rituals of constantly washing her hands and desperately trying to avoid contamination.


> Wow! What a beautiful day! Thank you, Rhonda and David for the amazing opportunity to share my story! I feel very selfish but I enjoyed every minute of it. You both made me feel so comfortable and welcome. You two are so incredibly AWESOME! You make a superb team! :)


>Sara Shane is a certified TEAM-CBT therapist practicing in the central valley of California (Stockton). She is multi-lingual and offers intensives—extended, single-session treatment of depression and all of the anxiety disorders. And, here’s something fantastic—although Sara is a superb therapist, her fees are modest, thus bucking the current trend of charging outrageous fees for psychotherapy in California. This is something I really admire and appreciate!

### [164: How to HELP, and how NOT to Help!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/164-how-to-help-and-how-not-to-help)

Lately, I’ve received numerous emails asking, in essence, "how can I help my loved one who has this or that problem?" I would say that I get several emails like that every week.
For example, here's one from a man we’ll call “Karl.”
Love you podcasts. Listen as often as I can. keep reading your books.
Our son is in an unhappy marriage. Last night we talked and he mentioned that there is no love in their marriage. Just coldness. The children "feel" the chasm. There is a lack of trust in the home.
Our son feels he did not protect the children in defense of their mom, even though he disagreed with her. Now the children feel their father does not have their best interests. Our daughter-in-law feels that everything is fine. She uses the passive-aggressive "silent treatment" to punish others.
Our son says she is controlling and manipulative, and that the children have become that way also. There's no truth in the home. Years ago, she wanted them to go to counseling, but our son refused; now the tables are turned.
Sad. We want to help but don't know how to approach it.
What podcasts would be helpful to us? And to our son and daughter-in-law? We visit our grandchildren often, sometimes one-on-one. Communications are open with them and with our son.
Daughter-in-law feels, and tells others, we are conspiring against her
Karl
Thank you Karl, for that moving email. It can be really sad and frustrating to see a couple in conflict who are at odds with each, **especially** when your son and grandchildren are involved. And I can imagine you might also be feeling anxious and a bit helpless, and deeply concerned!
When I wrote **Feeling Good** forty years ago, I tried to make it clear that the cognitive therapy tools I described in that book are for people to use to help themselves. It is okay to correct your own distorted negative thoughts in order to break out of a bad mood. But it is generally NOT a good idea to try to correct someone else’s distorted thoughts, because they’ll just get ticked off at you!
This is a very understandable error, because you may get really excited by the things I’m teaching, and how helpful they can be when you’re feeling depressed, anxious, or insecure. So it just makes sense that you would want to share these tools with others.
But those are generally NOT the tools to use when you’re talking to your son, daughter, spouse, or friend who’s feeling down in the dumps. There **is** a way to help someone you love who’s hurting—but you’ll have to use an entirely different set of tools and skills—the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf)—WITHOUT trying to “help.”

So, the short answer to your question is—skillful listening is all that’s called for. Anything more runs the risk of getting you into trouble. But this may require a radical change in the way you communicate, as well as your personal philosophy.

Let’s talk about what TO do, and what NOT to do when patients, friends or people you care about express angst, or seem troubled, or describe problems in their lives, and they seem to be hurting a lot.

**DO NOT**


* Give advice
* Try to help
* Try to cheer the person up
* Try to solve the problem s/he is struggling with
* Try to get the other person to think or act more positively
* Try to minimize the problem by saying it’s not that bad, or things will get better.
* Point out ways the other person may be thinking or acting in a self-defeating manner.
Before we tell you what **does** work, let me focus on just one of these errors, to bring it to life for you. Recently, Rhonda and I recorded a live therapy session with a man named who was upset because his mother had lost the use of her legs to due a rare neurological disorder, and needed much greater care in an assisted living facility. This required selling the house his mother was living so they could afford the assisted living facility, and it was a great loss for everyone, since Kevin was raised in that house, and his parents and grandparents had lived there, too.

After Rhonda and I empathized with him for about thirty minutes, we asked the other therapists to offer empathy as well, as part of their practice and training that evening. We stressed the importance of simply summarizing what Kevin had told us (Thought Empathy) and how he was feeling (Feeling Empathy), without trying to “help.” One of the therapists, who was new to the group, kind of missed the mark, She did what we call “cheerleading,” telling Kevin what a wonderful and heroic person he was without acknowledging what he’d be saying and how painful it was for him.

You’ll hear this brief excerpt from the session in the podcast. When we asked Kevin how he felt about her comment, he had to tell her that he was embarrassed, and not helped, by what she’d said.

Here’s why. When you don’t acknowledge someone’s profound negative feelings of loss, anxiety, sadness, anger, and more, you might unintentionally convey the message that you don’t want to hear about how they really feel inside. And when you cheerlead, it also conveys the message that the person is not very intelligent, and simply has to be cheered up, and then everything will be okay!

We cannot be too hard on this therapist, because her efforts came from the heart, and I'm sure she felt sad for this man. And most of us have made the same mistake at times, or even often. I frequently hear parents trying to cheer their children up, or trying to tell their children what to do, or how to change, without really listening.

But, most of the time, it just doesn’t work like that!

Now that you know what NOT to do, what can you do that WILL help?

**DO**

Use the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf), with an emphasis on the listening skills. One of the most important skills is called Feeling Empathy—simply acknowledging how the other person is feeling, and asking them to tell you more, and if you got it right.

For example, let’s say a friend or family member is procrastinating on something important, like a research report or college application, and is feeling pretty upset and self-critical. You could say something like this: “It sounds like you’re beating up on yourself for procrastinating, I’m wondering if you’re feeling



* down, sad or depressed?
* anxious, worried, pressured, or nervous?
* guilty or ashamed?
* inadequate, worthless, defective, or inferior?
* alone or lonely?
* humiliated or self-conscious?
* discouraged or hopeless?
* stuck or defeated?
* angry, annoyed, hurt, or upset?”
I find that people really like it when I ask these questions, and I let them answer each one. Then I ask them about their negative thoughts. What are they telling themselves? What are the upsetting messages?

When you use this approach, you are literally doing nothing to “help” the other person, but if you listen skillfully, she or he will probably really appreciate your listening, and you may end up feeling really close. In fact, I (David), had this exact experience just a couple days ago with a student who was struggling and feeling down.

Often, the person who’s depressed will be someone you love, like a family member, so your concerns for him or her, and your desire to “help,” are an expression of your love. But listening skillfully will likely be a whole lot more effective. And you can express your own feelings, too, with "I Feel" Statements, like "I feel sad to hear how down you've been feeling, because I love you a lot."

**Example**

A woman named Clarissa was concerned because her son, Billy, who is in his early 20s, had been severely depressed for several years, and had not responded to treatment with antidepressants and even lithium. Clarissa had read my book, **Feeling Good**, and listened to almost all of the Feeling Good Podcasts. She described herself as a true “TEAM-CBT convert because she’d worked with a therapist trained in TEAM-CBT and no longer suffered from the depression and anxiety she’d struggled with most of her adult life. She agreed with a lot of what I’d said on the podcasts about the chemical imbalance theory (there’s no convincing evidence for it) and antidepressants (recent research suggests they do not outperform placebos to a clinically significant degree).

But Billy was saying things like this:

“Mom, I KNOW I have a chemical imbalance because this cloud will suddenly come over me, and I feel TERRIBLE. It’s not about negative thoughts—I don’t have any negative thoughts. My depression is clearly the result of a chemical imbalance, and I feel doomed by my genes.”

Then Clarissa would try to cheer him up, which always failed, or would try to convince him that it’s not about a chemical imbalance and that if he really tried TEAM-CBT, he could overcome his depression, just as she had done. These are such common errors!

How could Clarissa respond more effectively? If she focuses on good listening skills, instead of trying to win an argument, she might say something like this:

“Billy, I really love you, and feel so sad to hear about your depression. You’re absolutely right, too. Sometimes a bad mood seems to come from out of the blue, with no rhyme or reason. And genes can be important. I've struggled with depression in the past, and maybe you've inherited some of my genes. Tell me more about how you’ve been feeling. Have you been feeling down, anxious, ashamed, hopeless, or angry? What you’re saying is so important, and I really want to her what's it's been like for you.”

Can you see that Billy would be more likely to open up and might even share some things that he’s been hiding, out of a sense of frustration, anger, or shame? And can you also see that providing some love and support—pure listening, with compassion—might be a lot more helpful than getting into an argument about the causes of depression? He might open up about all sorts of things that have been eating away at him—problems with girls, sex, sports, or his studies, or concerns about his looks, or even feelings of shame about his depression.

The next question is—when DO you help someone? And HOW do you help them.

The approach I use as a therapist might be the same approach you’d want to use. At the beginning of every therapy session, I empathize without trying to help, exactly as I’ve been teaching you in this podcast, and in this document, and I give the other person some time—typically about 30 minutes or so—just to vent while I use the Five Secrets of Effective Communication—listening skillfully—without trying to “help.”

Then I ask the patient to grade me on empathy. I say, “How am I doing so far in terms of understanding how you’re thinking and feeling? Would you give me an A, a B, a C, or perhaps even a D?”

Most of the time, the other person WILL give you a grade. If they give you an A, you’re in good shape. But if they give you an A-, or a B+, or worse, ask them to explain the part you’re missing, or not getting right.

When they tell you, you can use the Five Secrets again, summarizing the part you missed, and then ask what your grade is, to see if you’ve improved. Usually, your grade will improve a lot.

Do NOT try to “help” until you received an A!

So, let’s assume you’ve gotten an A. What then?

Then I do what’s called the Invitation Step in TEAM therapy—I ask if the other person wants help with any of the problems s/he has been discussing. You can ask the same question.

If the other person does NOT want help, but just wanted to talk and get support, your job is done. You can also ask if they want to talk some more. Most of the time, all people want is a little listening and support, and they’re not looking for help or advice.

But if the other person DOES want help, you can ask what kind of help they’re looking for. Then you can decide if you’re in a position to provide that type of help. Sometimes, the help they're looking for might not be something you can provide. For example, they may be angry at someone they're not getting along with, and may want you to tell the other person to change. I explain that this is not something I would know how to do, but I could possibly help them change the way they interact with that person.

This may sound really simple, but it takes a lot of practice and determination! It can be a lot harder than it looks.

Many people will NOT want to go down this road, and will insist on jumping in to help or cheerlead. You can do that if you want, but in my experience, pushing help on people who are hurting is rarely helpful. The “need” to help or rescue can result from your love and compassion, but it can also result from narcissism, codependency, or the desire to control or dominate another person. I see it as a kind of an addiction, too.

If you want to learn more about this, here are some things you can do:

* You can read my book, [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://amzn.to/2YSDP64">**Feeling Good**</a> <a href= "https://amzn.to/2YSDP64">**Together**</a>, and do the written exercises while reading, so you can master the <a href= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf). This is a BIG assignment, but the reward, in terms of more loving and satisfying relationships with the people you love, will be equally great.
* You can try using "I Feel" Statements and Feeling Empathy with at least one person every day this week.

**Question 1. Why do shrinks kill themselves?**
Dear Dr Burns,
Before I get to my question (which I hope you will consider addressing in your 'Ask David' segment of the podcast), I would like to extend my gratitude to you. Your book, Feeling Good, came to me at a time when I was struggling to make sense of my depression and anxiety, and it has been a vital part of my recovery journey. The exercises and the podcast have been such lifelines, and I am grateful to you for the incredible and life-changing work that you do.
I know you have addressed the topic of suicide in a previous episode, but I recently was struck by a piece of news from my alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, where a senior member of the college's counselling services (CAPS) died by suicide. Here was someone who had spent his life's work on promoting suicide prevention, and had a great deal of knowledge on resilience. How can we process/understand the decisions that someone like this might make to take his life. How can I arrive at the understanding that his decision doesn't necessarily spell doom for the rest of us? What TEAM-CBT exercises can we do to make sense of the world when it might not make much sense at first glance, during situations like these?
Thank you very, very much,
Sindhu
**Dr. David's Answer**
Thanks, Sindhu, this is a really great question.
I’ll put this in the Ask David folder. Should I use your name?

Here’s the short answer. It’s a lot like saying that an infectious disease expert shouldn’t get pneumonia, or that an orthopedic surgeon shouldn’t have back pain, or a broken leg. I know of at least three mental health professionals who have committed suicide, but my knowledge based is tiny. I’m sure there are thousands of mental health professionals who have committed suicide.

People can commit suicide for many reasons, and I can only mention a few here, as my knowledge, like yours, is limited.


* Hopelessness is one of the most common causes of suicide in depressed individuals. Hopelessness always results from cognitive distortions, and never from a valid appraisal of one’s circumstances. Depressed people often turn to suicide, thinking (wrongly) that it is the only escape from their suffering.
* You may have done something that you are profoundly ashamed of, and fear it is about to be made public. Like the fellow in New York arrested for child abuse who hung himself just a few weeks ago.
* I am convinced that sometimes people commit suicide to get back at someone they are angry with, someone perhaps who rejected them.
* Physician-assisted suicide. I believe that physician assisted suicide is absolutely indicated and compassionate if someone is in excruciating pain from an irreversible terminal illness.
* The Achievement Addiction. Feelings of failure and worthlessness. In our culture, we sometimes (wrongly) base our feelings of self-esteem on our success in life, our income, or our achievements. And so, if your achievements are only “ordinary,” you may feel worthless, like “a failure,” and kill yourself.
* The Love Addiction: Many people (wrongly) tell themselves they must be loved to feel happy and worthwhile, and then kill themselves when they are rejected by someone they thought they loved and “needed.”
* Drug and alcohol abuse: These habit, when severe, can greatly disrupt a person’s life. They can also make someone more impulsive, and more likely to jump or pull the trigger when intoxicated.
There are likely way more causes than just these common ones. For example, a psychotic process like schizophrenia might sometimes play a role as well.

I suspect you may have a hidden “Should Statement,” telling yourself that a mental health professional “should not” get depressed or have the urge to commit suicide. But to me, that would be a nonsensical claim, and it isn’t even clear to me why you might think that way. In fact, most people are drawn to this profession because of their own unresolved suffering. There is, I suspect, MORE depression and anxiety in mental health professionals, but I have not seen data, so I’m not certain of this. But I’ve trained tens of thousands of mental health professionals, and pretty much ALL of the ones I’ve known personally have struggled at times, and sometimes intensely.

People also ask, “Why did so and so commit suicide? S/he was so famous and loved and wealthy!” Well, famous and loved and wealthy people often suffer and commit suicide, too.

Finally, I would say that suicide is both tragic and devastating—for the patient for sure, for the family and friends who typically suffer for years, and for the therapist as well. Fortunately, the family and friends can be helped, if they ask, but it is too late for the person who was depressed. And the tragedy is needless in most cases, since the patient’s intense negative feelings can be treated effectively in nearly all cases.

David

**Question 2. How can you find out if a friend or loved one is suicidal?**

Many people are afraid to ask a depressed friend or family member if they are feeling suicidal, fearing this will create conflict or may even cause the person to become suicidal. For the most part, these fears are unfounded, and the biggest mistake could be avoiding the topic.

Most people who are feeling suicidal are willing to discuss their feelings fairly openly. Several types of questions can be useful.

**Suicidal thoughts or fantasies.** Most people with depression due have suicidal thoughts or fantasies from time to time, and these are not necessarily dangerous.

First, you can ask, “do you sometimes feel hopeless, or have thoughts of death, or wishing you were dead?” If s/he says yes, you can ask him / her to tell you about these thoughts and feelings. You can also ask if s/he thinks of suicide as the only way out of his / her suffering.

Second, you can ask if s/he simply has passive suicidal thoughts, like “Sometimes I feel like I’d be better off if I were dead,” or active suicidal thoughts, like, “Sometimes I have fantasies of killing myself.”

**Suicidal urges.** You can ask if s/he sometimes has urges to kill himself / herself. Suicidal thoughts or fantasies without suicidal urges are usually not especially dangerous.

**Suicidal plans.** You can ask if s/he has made any plans to actually commit suicide. If so, what method would s/he use? Jumping? Shooting? Hanging? Cutting?

You can also ask if s/he has been acting on these plans. For example, if shooting is the choice, you can ask if s/he has access to a gun and bullets. If jumping is the choice, you can ask where s/he plans to jump from.

**Deterrents.** When evaluating suicide, you can also ask if there are any strong deterrents, such as religious beliefs, impact on family and friends, and so forth. If there are no strong deterrents, the situation is more dangerous.

**Desire to live, desire to die**. You can also ask the person how strong their desire to live is, and how strong is their desire to die?

**Past suicide attempts.** If the person has made suicide attempts in the past, the risk of a future suicide attempt is greater.

**Drugs and alcohol.** You can ask if the person drinks or uses drugs, and has ever has a stronger urge to commit suicide when intoxicated. This is a danger sign.

**Impulsiveness.** Some people make suicide attempts when they’re feeling impulsive, kind of on the spur of the moment. You can ask if they every have these kids of sudden impulses.

**Willingness to reach out.** You can ask if they’d be willing to reach out and ask for help if they ever have a suicidal urge.

**Honesty.** You can ask if they were felt reasonably open and honest in asking your questions, or if it was difficult to answer some of the questions.

Once you have explored these types of questions, you can decide whether action is necessary. If the person seems in danger of making a suicide attempt, you can bring him / her to an emergency room for an evaluation.

If s/he refuses, you can dial 911 and ask for help. Generally, the police will come immediately and do a safety check, and bring the person to an emergency room involuntarily if necessary. You can also call his or her therapist and alert that person to the situation.

This may all sound grim and very unpleasant, but these kinds of conversations can sometimes be lifesaving, and can protect you from much greater pain later on.

In a future podcast, we will focus on this question: How do you treat someone who is suicidal using TEAM-CBT?

### [166: Escape from Physical Pain: An Interview with Dr. David Hanscom](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/166-escape-from-physical-pain-an-interview-with-dr-david-hanscom)

In today's podcast, David and Rhonda interview Dr. David Hanscom, a renowned and controversial spine surgeon who gave up a large and lucrative surgical practice in favor of helping and educating people struggling with back pain, directing them on the path to recovery **without** surgery or drugs.
Dr. Hanscom describes his personal journey and recovery from panic, pain, and other disabling somatic symptoms when he read Dr. Burns' book, [Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy](https://amzn.to/2z7FZPS), and began doing the written triple column technique to challenge his own negative thoughts and overcome his own feelings of depression, panic, hopelessness, and anger.
He also began to study alarming research reports indicating that many of the surgical procedures were no more effective than placebos; and even worse, he could see that back surgery often had damaging and even disabling and horrific effects on patients. And he also discovered that most of the patients seeking surgery for back pain could be helped simply through talk therapy and support, by focusing on the problems in their lives, rather than simply focusing on pain and pills.
Dr. Burns supports Dr. Hanscom's premise, that even physical pain can have powerful psychological causes and cures. Dr. Burns briefly summarizes his own research on hospitalized inpatients with significant emotional problems as well as chronic pain. He wanted to answer the question of why physical pain and negative feelings so often go hand-in-hand.

To find out, he studied changes in negative feelings, like depression, anxiety and anger, as well as the intensity of pain, in more than 100 patients attending a 90 minute cognitive therapy group. He saw that there were often massive shifts in negative feelings, like depression, anxiety, and anger, as well as the severity of physical pain, during the groups.

He analyzed the data with sophisticated statistical modeling techniques to evaluate two competing theories about why pain and negative feelings go hand-in-hand.


* Physical pain could cause negative feelings, like depression, anxiety and anger. This seems plausible, since physical pain is so debilitating, and just plain awful.
* Negative feelings could have a causal effect on physical pain.
The analyses indicated that there were causal effects in both directions, but the most powerful effect, by far, was the effect of negative emotions on physical pain. In fact, the analyses indicated that, on average, half of the physical pain these patients were experiencing, on average, was the direct result of their negative emotions.

This means that if you're in pain, and you're emotionally upset, which would be totally understandable, that a great deal of the pain you are feeling is the result of a magnification of the pain by your negative emotions.

There is a positive implication of this finding that supports what Dr. Hansom is saying--namely, that if you are in pain, including chronic pain, and you are willing to overcome your negative feelings and deal with the problems in your life, there is a good chance that your pain will improve substantially. Some people, as David saw in the groups, will experience a total elimination of pain--something he often observed within the group.

It is also possible that you will experience a reduction of your pain, but not a complete elimination. And it is possible that your pain will not improve when your negative feelings disappear--but at least you won't have to struggle with pain and depression!

So he has now devoted his life to making people, as well as his surgical colleagues, aware of the realities vs. the myths of back surgery. To learn more, visit his [Back in Control](http://www.BackInControl.com">website</a>, or pick up a copy of his terrific book, <a href= "https://backincontrol.com/book/back-in-control-a-spine-surgeons-roadmap-out-of-chronic-pain/). The book includes a section on your personal roadmap out of pain.

Rhonda and I are incredibly grateful to Dr. Hanscom for this illuminating, challenging, and profoundly personal interview. We hope you enjoy it! And if you've been struggling with any kind of chronic or debilitating pain, we hope you will find some hope, as well as a drug-free path to recovery!

### [167: Feeling Great: Professor Mark Noble on TEAM-CBT and the Brain](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/167-feeling-great-professor-mark-noble-on-team-cbt-and-the-brain)

<img class="size-full wp-image-14487 aligncenter" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mark-Noble-002-3108933267-1570128112316.jpg" alt="Mark Noble (002)" width="320" height="240" />
Professor Mark Noble was our special guest on the one hundredth **Feeling Good Podcast.** In that podcast, he described the effects of TEAM-CBT on the human brain. Many listeners were enthralled by Dr. Noble's revolutionary ideas!
Today, Dr. Noble returns to discuss his illuminating ideas, and prevents an overview of his chapter entitled, "TEAM CBT and the Art of Micro-Neurosurgery: A Brain User's Guide to Feeling Great," which will appear in David's new book, **Feeling Great**, which will be released by PESI in 2020.
Rhonda begins the podcast by asking how Dr. Noble met Dr. Burns. What brought the two of you together?
Dr. Noble explains that he read about David's work on drug-free treatments for depression in the October, 2013 issue of Stanford Magazine entitled [Mind Over Misery,](https://stanfordmag.org/contents/mind-over-misery) This article became the most-read article in the history of the Stanford Magazine.  Dr. Noble was particularly interested in drug-free treatments for depression because of some alarming research emerging in his laboratory on the central nervous system impact of some popular antidepressants on lysosomes in the brain.
So, Dr. Noble made a trip to California so he could visit David's Tuesday training group at Stanford and participate in one of David's famous Sunday hikes. This was so much fun, and so intellectually rewarding, that he become an irregular regular at the Tuesday groups and Sunday hikes! Since that time, there have been many Sunday hikes and many Tuesday groups in the emerging friendship and professional collaboration between David and Dr. Noble.

David describes some of the resistance he runs into from mental health professionals who cannot believe that the rapid recoveries David sees in TEAM-CBT can be real. Most therapists were trained to believe that depression develops slowly, over many years, and that effective treatment must also be very slow, often requiring many years, or even more than a decade of weekly sessions. But Dr. Noble argues that the amazingly rapid changes David routinely sees in TEAM-CBT are actually highly consistent with the latest neuroscience understanding of how the human brain works.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6613" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_2486.jpg" alt="IMG_2486" width="2016" height="1511" />

David and Dr. Noble on a Sunday hike

In fact, Dr. Noble presents the amazing idea that if you had to invent a form of psychotherapy that was specifically developed to capitalize on how the brain works, you would come up with something very much like TEAM-CBT.

Dr. Noble discusses neuroscience in simple, everyday terms that anyone can understand. Even me (david)! Dr. Noble teaches in a kind of clear, accessible way of communicating that I (david) admire greatly. I have seen this in all of the teachers that I've admired the most in college, medical school and beyond.

Dr. Noble explains that if you want to change the way you think, feel, and behave, you have to change certain specific networks in your brain. That's because networks of nerves are the biological equivalents of thoughts.

But how do you do that? How can you change the networks in your brain that cause you to feel depressed, anxious, and inadequate? It's through two basic concepts of neuroscience called FTWT and WTFT! In Dr. Burns' new book, Dr. Noble writes:

"One of the most famous concepts in the science of learning is called, "What **F**ires **T**ogether **W**ires **T**ogether" (**FTWT**). Nerve cells that frequently interact with each other become functionally connected, and the more they fire together, the stronger the connections become. This is how new networks are formed and how existing networks become stronger.

"In addition, nerve cells that are **W**ired **T**ogether tend to **F**ire **T**ogether (**WTFT**). WTFT. This idea explains why once you've learned something it gets easier to repeat it every time you do it."

Dr. Noble also views TEAM-CBT as a kind of micro-neurosurgery, because you replace highly selected negative brain circuits that send distorted signals, such as "I'm not good enough," or "I'll never recover," with new circuits that are far more accurate and positive.

Dr. Noble also explains why Dr. Burns' concept of "Fractal Psychotherapy" is so complimentary to our understanding of the human brain, as are the other components of TEAM-CBT, including T = Testing, E = Empathy, A = Assessment of Resistance, and M = Methods.

 

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6608" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_2401-411919755-1570127154114.jpg" alt="img_2401.jpg" width="1508" height="1131" />

David and Dr. Noble following a Sunday hike, just before the dim sum feast with the hiking group at the Joy Luck Palace in Cupertino, California, Notice the slightly bulging but happy stomachs from both doctors!

Dr. Noble also explains why conventional therapy--where the patient comes in week after week to vent about his / her problems--may actually make the patient worse. This is because the neurons that Fire Together every week, actually Wire Together. So, in simple neuroscience terms, conventional therapy may actually lead patients in the wrong direction, by strengthening the negative circuits in the brain.

You will love this down-to-earth discussion of TEAM-CBT and the human brain!

### [168: Ask David: The Blushing Cure, How to Heal a Broken Heart, Treating Anorexia, and more!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/168-ask-david-the-blushing-cure-how-to-heal-a-broken-heart-treating-anorexia-and-more)

Happy Thanksgiving if you live in the United States! This is my favorite holiday, because it means just hanging out with the people you love, eating some wonderful food together, and doing simple things like a family hike, without the commercialism and "push" of some of the other holidays. I wish the very best to you and yours, too!
Today, Rhonda could not join us due to Yom Kippur, the highest Jewish holy day. So we will record three podcasts with my wonderful neighbor, Dave Fribush, as host. In addition, we are joined by Michael Simpson, who flew out from New York to attend my Empathy workshop two days ago. He will also join the Tuesday group at Stanford tonight. Michael is doing a massive upgrade / fast lift of my website, www.feelinggood.com, which will likely be published by the time you read this. Let us know what you think about the new "look."
Dave Fribush, Michael and I answer many thought-provoking questions submitted by listeners like you!
**1. How can I overcome my fear of blushing?**
Hi David,
Hopefully this reaches you well. I am dealing with Erythrophobia (the fear of blushing) and have been having issues with going out with friends, being in public, in work meetings, etc. The weird part is that I don't even get red, but the visualization in my head is so vivid sometimes (Kool-Aid man) that I believe it.
Sometimes, if I think about it long enough (like an internal panic attack for 20+min), I get kind of red. . . . Currently, I am trying to just break this habit and I have been reading your book **When Panic Attacks** and it has been pretty good at helping me.
[<img class= " wp-image-6 aligncenter" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/whenpanicattacks.jpg" alt="whenpanicattacks" width="101" height="151" />](https://amzn.to/2H91zYI)
I have been facing my fears and going out into public and hanging out with friends; I'm kind of anxious on the inside of getting red all of sudden, which puts me on edge. I look in the mirror and see that I am not red, but it’s been hard to train my brain to believe it. I started reading your book five days ago and it has helped a lot already. Since then, I have been able to accept
I don't mind being occasionally red or nervous and I'm fairly confident, but I struggle to accept the idea of being perpetually red? Part of me wants to accept the idea that "Eff-it! If I'm red, I'm red! That's who I am,” but another part of me knows that it's not true; occasionally I might blush but it’s not the norm.
Please let me know if you have any advice. I think this might be a great podcast topic because I know a lot of people with Rosacea deal with anxiety and I'm sure that would help a lot of others.

Best, Alex

Hi Alex,

I have a awesome [podcast on the fear of blushing!](https://feelinggood.com/2018/05/14/088-role-play-techniques-feared-fantasy-revisited/)) You might find it helpful (Podcast #88, published on May 14, 2018.)

I cannot do therapy through this medium, so this is just general teaching, but exposure / self-disclosure in one method you could use. You could tell 5 to 10 strangers every day something like this:

“Could I speak to you for a moment? I’ve had the fear of blushing almost all of my life, and I’ve been hiding it from everybody out of shame. But today, I’ve decided to stop hiding and being ashamed, so I’ve decided to tell people, and that's why I'm telling you.”

You’ll find tons of additional ideas in the podcast and in one of my books, like the one you’re reading, **[The Feeling Good Handbook](https://amzn.to/2H91zYI">When Panic Attacks</a>**, as well as **<a href="https://amzn.to/2Hb4NLs)**.

Actually, blushing is NEVER a problem. The only problem is the shame. Without the shame, the blushing, like shyness, can be an asset, making you more human and more appealing.

Also, on my Sunday hike yesterday, we were joined by a young Stanford dermatologist who showed us some photos and videos of a new laser treatment for rosacea, which is similar to blushing. Apparently, the treatment is quite effective.

Thanks, David

**2. How can you get over a broken heart?**

Hi David,

First of all, I would like to thank you from my bottom of my heart for the wonderful jobs you are doing. I have a question regarding aftermath of divorce and searched [feelinggood.com](http://feelinggood.com) for any post but I couldn't find any. My best friend is going through divorce process and he cannot forget the good memories he had with this wife. He still loves her so much and would like to continue their relationship but she's not interested in that. They have been separated for 4 years and he tried his best to bring her back.

How can I help him move forward? Those good memories are haunting him?

Thanks,

Didi

Hi Didi,

Thanks for your terrific question, as most of us were rejected by someone we loved at some point in our lives.

You’re in luck! We just recorded a podcast on how to help a friend or loved one who’s hurting, and by the time you read this, it will have been published. It's Podcast #164 on “How to HELP, and how NOT to Help!” It was published on October 28, 2019. You can find the link on [the list of all of the published podcasts](https://feelinggood.com/list-of-feeling-good-podcasts/) on my website. I would **definitely** listen before trying to "help" your friend!

Resources for your friend might include the book I wrote on this topic, which is called [Intimate Connections](https://amzn.to/2H91zYI). One of the themes is that rejection could never upset a human being—only distorted thoughts about being rejected. This book can be helpful to the many people who have been divorced, or who have broken up with someone they loved, and are having trouble getting back into the dating game effectively, as well as the many people who are having trouble getting into the dating game for the first time.

[<img class= " size-full wp-image-60 aligncenter" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/intimateconnections.gif" alt="intimateconnections" width="100" height="168" />](https://amzn.to/2Z6RDFv)

Another great resource for him would be the chapter on the Love Addiction in **[Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy](https://amzn.to/2z7FZPS)**. It describes a woman who had just been rejected by her husband, who was having an affair with his secretary, and she was telling herself that she couldn’t be happy without his love. The story had an amazing outcome, and might be very helpful for your friend.

[<img class= " wp-image-14080 aligncenter" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/download-002.jpeg" alt="download (002)" width="95" height="156" />](https://amzn.to/2z7FZPS)

Of course, motivation is incredibly important. Your friend might not want to be “cured,” so to speak, since his depression and thoughts about his Ex keep the relationship alive in his mind, and also give him an excuse to avoid dating and developing new relationships, which can be anxiety-provoking and effortful for just about anybody!

David

**3. How would you treat someone with anorexia nervosa?**

This question was submitted by our friend, Professor Mark Noble, on behalf of one of his colleagues at the University of Rochester.

I, David, explain what anorexia is, and describe my experience with an anorexia patient I treated in Philadelphia when she was discharged from the inpatient unit. I emphasize the need for the TEAM-CBT technique called the Gentle Ultimatum, since the patient didn't want o maintain her weight at a safe level, and just wanted to talk talk talk during sessions without doing any psychotherapy homework. 

I also describe the “Coercive Therapy” also called F[amily Therapy for anorexi](http://www.maudsleyparents.org/whatismaudsley.html)a,  developed at the Maudsley in London, and we talk about how the same principle—getting the parents to work together on the same team, with firmness, intense mutual support, and compassionate insistence—works for almost any problem children are having.

However, this requires the parents to support one another, and work together as a strong and loving team, and many parents who are in conflict will find it difficult to do this, since the urge to argue and fight can be so powerful. Then the parents sacrifice the well-being and happiness of their children in the name of ongoing war (blame, fighting, sticking up for “truth,” and so forth).

Dave F. and Michael Simpson ask why this approach of getting parents to work together, can be so incredibly powerful and helpful to children.

### [169: More on Social Anxiety-The Case for Vulnerability!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/169-more-on-social-anxiety-the-case-for-vulnerability-0)

Today's podcast features Michael Simpson, a friend and colleague of Dr Burns, who describes his personal battle with social anxiety. Dave Fribush will again be our host, since Rhonda is celebrating the important religious holiday of Yom Kippur with her family.
Michael first became acquainted with David when he read David’s book, **When Panic Attacks**, which he says was SO GOOD! But when he went to David’s website, [www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com), he was shocked to see so much terrific free content for people, but the website was not well-presented. In fact, it was pretty sucky!
[<img class= " wp-image-6 aligncenter" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/whenpanicattacks.jpg" alt="whenpanicattacks" width="136" height="205" />](https://amzn.to/2H91zYI)
So, Michael sent David a brief video, pointing out all the problems, and offered to redo the website in exchange for some help with his social anxiety—and the relationship took off from there!
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael describes his own experiences with social anxiety, which amounts to slight to moderate nervousness, tension and dis-ease during interactions with people. There is no apparent pattern to his triggers: he can become anxious (or not) around friends, strangers, men, women he is attracted to, and women he is not attracted to. He experiences the anxiety physically: butterflies in his stomach, tension around his face and a general tightness in his body. He is usually unaware of his negative thoughts, which involve fears of looking weak, being judged by others because of his anxiety, and being unable to connect with others while he is feeling anxious. He usually tries to hide all of these fears.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, his social anxiety does not appear to inhibit him — he is a tall, handsome, articulate man, and when he confides his social anxiety to others, they are usually extremely surprised that someone who outwardly appears so confident could possibly be struggling with social anxiety. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael describes one of his first “homework assignments” from Dr. Burns, who suggested that instead of hiding his anxiety, he should approach attractive women he encounters on the street and simply tell them that sometimes he becomes anxious when speaking to attractive women. The purpose of the exercise was to confront his fear (Exposure) and do a real-world experiment to find out if his fears of being judged are realistic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening up about his anxiety was very challenging for Michael, to say the least, given that he had spent most of his life trying to hide it. He describes walking around Times Square in New York City, procrastinating, and trying to muster up the courage to follow through on his assignment. </span>

So, he finally approached a woman from Brazil whom he found exceptionally attractive. He kind of had to chase after her to stop her to tell her. We can call her Adrianna. Adrianna did not judge or reject Michael, and the two of them seemed hit it off tremendously. And they talked and hung out together every day.

Michael described their relationship as one of the deepest and most fulfilling relationships he’d ever experienced. He was amazed by Adrianna’s warmth, compassion, and openness, and appreciated the respect and love she conveyed to everyone she met. Michael also describes visiting her and spending a week together in Brazil after she returned home.

One of the take-home messages for Michael was that vulnerability, rather than trying to be cool, or trying to impress people that you have it all together, is the real key to intimacy and joy in our relationships with others.

Dave Fribush and David Burns feel very indebted to Michael for his awesome work on today’s podcast. Michael hopes his experiences will be helpful to any of you who have also struggled at times with social anxiety.

My new website makeover will probably be launched by the time you read this, so let us know what you think! It's will be at the same address: www.feelinggood.com.

If you are struggling with social anxiety, you might also enjoy my book, **Intimate Connections**. It's now a bit dated, but the ideas can still be tremendously helpful. Here's an unsolicited endorsement I recently received from a young professional woman:


"I’d like to share a story about a book I started reading on my trip to Asheville this past weekend.  On the plane, both tears and uncontrollable laughter simultaneously streamed from my face while reading the **Intimate Connections** book.  No more peanut butter and jelly sandwiches telling myself what a loser I am!"

### [170: Ask David: Helping Abused Women, and the Case Against Wellness!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/170-ask-david-helping-abused-women-and-the-case-against-wellness)

Today, Rhonda could not join us due to the religious holidays, so we have recorded several podcasts with my wonderful neighbor, Dave Fribush, as host. In addition, we are joined by Michael Simpson, a friend and colleague from New York.
Dave, Michael and I answer two thought-provoking questions!
**1. Working with Abused Women**
Hi David (and Rhonda!),
I want to start out by stating how much I love your podcast. It has helped me understand myself, and, in turn, has made me a much more effective counselor.
I'm a drug and alcohol counselor, working here in Los Angeles. I work primarily with women from 18 - 25 years old who have aged out of the foster care system. They are an endearing group of women, as I know you are aware (I've heard you speak of working with this population), and they just want to feel loved and worthy. However, their deep-seated beliefs of being unworthy of good things happening in their lives prevents them from attaining their goals of getting jobs, getting their children back, and gaining housing.
These deep-seated beliefs are based on mistreatment by their families of origin, and their subsequent experiences in the social services system. Most were sexually abused or physically abused as children, taken out of their homes, then bounced around from one Foster Care family to the next.
Despite my best efforts, the majority of these women go back out to the streets just shy of completing our 6- to 12-month treatment program. Once on the streets they return to drug dealing, prostitution, and crime. After which, if they are lucky, they get picked up and incarcerated. Many die on the streets of drug overdoses or murder.
I'm using all of the tools I can to help them change their core beliefs, but it is challenging to say the least!
My question to you is—is there a book coming out which goes into depth about T.E.A.M. therapy? I need to become the most effective counselor I can in order to help these women recover and lead normal lives.
Thank you so much for your help! Keep up the good work. You are definitely saving lives!!

Pennie

Hi Pennie,

Thank you so much for your question. I did work with this population at the Presbyterian / University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, and found the patients to be incredibly rewarding and hungry for help, love, and connection, as you have said. I’m sure it is heart-breaking for you to see so many fall short, continue to struggle, and even die on the streets.

I found this population to be particularly easy and rewarding to work with because they seemed so grateful to be getting any kind of help at all. Many of our patients were homeless, and about a quarter of them could not read or write. We gave them more than eight hours of cognitive group therapy every day in a residential treatment setting, so they got 40 to 50 hours of therapy per week. The program was very inexpensive to run, and was more or less free to the participants, paid for by some type of medical assistance insurance, as well as by our hospital. Most patients showed dramatic changes within three or four days. The average length of stay was something like a week or ten days or so.

In today's podcast, I describe a patient in one of our groups, a woman who was severely depressed. She thought of herself as "weak" and "a bad mother." She recovered from her depression in just 20 minutes or so when I used a TEAM-CBT method called "The Paradoxical Double Standard Technique.

My book, **Ten Days to Self-Esteem, **is the program we used at my hospital in Philadelphia when working with this population. It is a simplified version of CBT, and it is a ten-step program that can be administered individually or in groups (which I prefer.) It is written using simple words for individuals with little education.

[<img class= "alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tendays.gif" alt="tendays" width="100" height="133" />](https://amzn.to/2zftQsB)

We gave a copy to every patient entering our program, and found that really boosted our outcomes. The hospital purchased them in quantities of 50 or more, and got the wholesale price, which made the books cheaper than having to copy the materials for the patients.

There's also a companion **Ten Days to Self-Esteem**, The Leader's Manual**, that you can get as an eBook. It shows the group leaders how to set the groups up and what to do at each of the ten group sessions.

[<img class= "alignnone size-full wp-image-54" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tendays-leader.gif" alt="tendays-leader" width="100" height="130" />](https://amzn.to/2YX2SoL)

There are many additional resources for you, if you'd like to learn more about CBT, as well as TEAM-CBT. First, my new book,  **Feeling Great,** is now at the publisher, PESI, and should be coming out in 2020. I'll update you as more details become available. But yes, it does have all the new TEAM-CBT stuff in it. It is intended for therapists as well as the general public, and features lots of written exercises while you read, so you can really master the many new methods and concepts.

My psychotherapy eBook, [T**ools, Not Schools, of Therapy**,](http://aaa-ebook-order-form-for-website-v-1.pdf) is for therapists, and we use it in all of our TEAM-CBT training programs. It is an interactive book that shows you how to do TEAM-CBT in a step-by-step way. this book also features many challenging interactive written exercises to complete as you read.

You might enjoy some of my [the Feeling Good Institute](https://feelinggood.com/workshops/">in person workshops</a>, as well as the many weekly online TEAM-CBT training programs at <a href="http://www.feelinggoodinstitute.com/).  My one day workshops with Dr. Jill Levitt are really well received, and you can join online from anywhere in the world. My yearly intensives in the US and Canada are usually pretty awesome as well.

I hope this information is helpful, and Iwish you the very best in the important and compassionate work you are doing with this incredibly deserving group of women who are suffering so greatly!

**2. Why don’t you advocate “Wellness” or “Holistic” Approaches?**

A therapist named Georgina recently emailed me and was pretty excited about her clinical work which was dedicated to “Wellness” and to “Holistic” treatment methods. I mentioned in an email that I am “intensely anti-wellness and anti-holistic.”

She sounded a bit shocked and added: “I'm one of those clinicians who provide consults to other clinicians on Pilates and yoga in integrative psychiatry.”

Hi Georgina,

Thanks for your thoughtful emails! I know my statement was “politically incorrect” in an era that emphasizes lots of non-specific treatment methods like meditation, healthy dieting, daily exercise, yoga, and so forth.

The quick answer to your question, which you can also hear in the podcast on “fractal psychotherapy,” ([https://feelinggood.com/2019/03/04/130-whats-fractal-psychotherapy/](https://feelinggood.com/2019/03/04/130-whats-fractal-psychotherapy/)) is that I focus narrowly on one specific moment when the patient was upset, and if it is an individual mood problem, like depression or anxiety, I ask the patient to record his or her negative thoughts and feelings at that specific moment on the Daily Mood Log. This activates just a few brain networks, out of the billions or trillions of networks in the brain, and we selectively modify those networks using techniques specifically chosen for this individual patient. There are no no-specific interventions.

The goal is rapid complete recovery followed by highly specific Relapse Prevention Training, so the patient will know exactly what to do the next time s/he falls into the black hole of depression, hopelessness, and despair. Essentially, I give the patient a little ladder that she or he can use the next time the Negative Thoughts return.

No one can feel happy all the time, but nearly all people can learn to limit those bumps in the road that we all encounter from time to time.

It sounds like the work you do for patients with Parkinson’s Disease is terrific, and desperately needed. My father in law died of Parkinson’s Disease several years ago, and we saw and experienced personally what a devastating and tragic disease it is.

Although I do not include any ”wellness” or “holistic” tools or concepts in my treatment plans, I have nothing against aerobic exercise, yoga (my daughter totally loves it!), meditation (my host, Rhonda, is a strong advocate), or a healthy diet, or anything else someone may find fun, exciting or helpful. It’s just that I’m trained in, and have developed, highly specific, super-fast acting treatments.

I believe that “non-specific techniques” have only a placebo effect on mood, although the placebo effect itself can be quite strong and potentially very helpful. In addition, I believe that non-specific techniques can ONLY change mood if you change the way you think.

So, if you jog, or eat a healthy diet, or meditate daily, and tell yourself, “Wow, I’m really living a healthy life,” you will feel good if you believe this thought. The jogging or food you eat will not, itself, cure your depression, or panic attacks, or fix your broken marriage, or help you recover from OCD, or PTSD, and so forth.

These conditions ARE highly treatable, however, using specific, fast-acting techniques that are individualized to you. We call this treatment TEAM-CBT. Again, I’m sure that many people will HATE what I just said, but I guess we will need some pretty refined research—research that’s never been done—to find out! The research that’s out there definitely **cannot** answer this question.

All I offer is a quick cure for specific problems. I’m not offering “everything” to “everybody.” I am aware, too, that my answer may be cheered by some and may be angrily booed by others. I like to speak from the heart, and from my experience, but I’m often wrong, and sometimes way off the mark, so no problem if you disagree or think I’m nuts!

You might also find our [second](https://feelinggood.com/2019/02/25/129-flexing-the-mindfulness-meditation-muscle/"> first</a> and <a href= "https://feelinggood.com/2019/04/15/137-mindfulness-part-2-muscle-or-myth/) podcasts on Mindfulness Meditation to be useful or interesting.

### [171: Ask David: "Burn Out," Physical Pain, and more](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/171-ask-david-burn-out-physical-pain-and-more)

Today, Rhonda rejoins us as host after a three week hiatus! My neighbor, Dave Fribush, joins us as well, as we answer two thought-provoking questions!
* Is it possible to treat “burnout?”
* Can negative feelings can make physical pain worse?
**1. Does "burnout" exist? How do you treat it?**
**Comment:** Hi!
I have been listening to your podcast for a while now and it has helped, and has encouraged me and made me feel less alone. Thank for your work and sharing your podcast with us!
My situation now is very much defined by my burnout syndrome (a medical diagnosis in Sweden, not sure about the US) and/or depression. From what I’ve learnt there is no evidence of CBT as a treatment for burnout - really nothing other than adaptations at your workplace. What triggered me to ”hit the wall” was studying too hard and not giving my body and mind time to recover.
Do you have any thoughts on burnout and effective treatment of it? I feel I have made huge progress in the underlying reasons to my burnout like perfectionism, performance-based self-esteem, figuring out how I want my life to be, who I am etc (although the last one is a big one!). All this with the help of CBT and other sorts of therapy. What remains is mental fatigue, on and off anxiety, not being able to focus and hardly any mental or emotional resilience.
Through healthcare, you are basically treated for depression, the treatment being anti-depressants. I’ve been on sick leave full time for over four years now, am in my late twenties and am constantly frustrated, sad and feeling stuck. I want to get going towards this life I now know that I want but I don’t seem to get any better. I eat and sleep well and exercise. I realize this could be a complete medical question but nobody REALLY seems to know anything about burnout. A long question but hey ho :) Would be grateful for any thoughts you might have, thanks again!
Sincerely,
Elisabeth

Hi Elisabeth,

I’m sorry to hear that you’ve been struggling for some time, but I'm glad you've been making progress, and I'm so glad you wrote to me.

To my way of thinking, there is really no such “thing” as burnout. Depression, anxiety, anger, and other negative feelings do exist. Burnout is just a vague buzzword for feeling upset when something upsetting has happened.

When I was in clinical practice, I saw as many as 17 depressed and anxious patients in one day, and as the day went on, I just got higher and higher and more energetic. That's because I loved what I was doing and felt I had something to offer, a lot, actually. I only got "burned out," or unhappy, if I felt I had said something that hurt someone's feelings, or if I had not done a good job for someone. Then I got really upset, but it was my thoughts, and not what I was doing, that caused my feelings. That, of course, is the cognitive model.

I found it helpful to zero in on one moment when I was feeling depressed, anxious, or “burned out,” and to do a Daily Mood Log focusing on that moment. I’ll attach one to this email in case you are interested. I’ve also included a completed one so you can see how it works. This is not a similar case, just something I grabbed by way of illustration.

Thanks,

David (a fellow Swede)

On the show, I describe one of the most stressful experiences of my career, when I appeared on a Philadelphia TV show with Maury Povich, and a patient of mine threatened to commit suicide. Fortunately, the story had a surprise ending that was very positive.

So my message is one of hope. The idea is to focus on some specific thing you are upset about, as opposed to getting overly focused on a concept like "burnout."

I think we all feel pretty exhausted at times, and if you've been studying or working too hard, it definitely makes sense to take a break to take care of yourself. When I transferred from my residency training program at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, to the residency program at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, one of my supervisors gave me this advice--he told me to make sure I set aside at least one half a day a week to stare at walls.

What he meant was that I was working intensely, 24/7, during the first two years of my residency, and he wanted to make sure I gave myself a break to rest from time to time. So every Sunday afternoon I just watched football games on TV, often with a cat on my lap. This was refreshing and helpful, and my supervisor's advice helped me avoid feeling guilty for not working 24/7!

**2. More on physical pain. Is it really true that negative feelings can make physical pain worse?**

We recently did a podcast with Dr. David Hanscom, a back surgeon who emphasized non-surgical treatments for back pain that can be surprisingly helpful. In that podcast, I described my research indicating that 50% of the pain we experience can the result of negative feelings, such as depression, anxiety, and anger. And if you can reduce or eliminate those negative feelings, your physical pain will often diminish substantially, and may even disappear entirely.

I first discovered this amazing phenomenon when I had a dramatic and traumatic personal experience as a medical student. One night I was drinking beer at a bar in Palo Alto, and hurt a commotion, and turned to look. A fight had broken out, and although I was not involved in the fight, I saw a beer mug flying in slow motion toward my face. It hit my jaw, and glass exploded everywhere, and blood came gushing out of my mouth.  I realized that my jaw was broken, and my front teeth were loose as well, so I ran outside to my old VW Beetle and drove at high speed to the emergency room of the Stanford Hospital. I ran inside and announced that I was a medical student and my jaw was broken.

They put me on a gurney, and ordered an x-ray. I was in intense pain, and I was scared and angry, and still intoxicated, and probably wasn't the most cooperative patient.

Eventually, a plastic surgeon was consulted and he talked to me after reviewing the X-ray. He explained that I had a broken jaw, and that he was going to hospital me and do surgery in the morning. He said my jaw would be wired shut for six weeks.

I asked if I was going to lose my front teeth that were loose. He said he didn't think so, but that I would have a dental consult to check things out after they removed the wires on my jaw in six weeks. Then he said that he knew I was in severe pain, and that he'd ordered pain shots for me during the night. He said he wanted me to be comfortable, and explained that he wanted me to request a pain shot any time I was in pain during the night. Then he put his hand on my shoulder and said, "This is very routine, and you're going to be fine."

At that very moment, my pain instantly went from severe to zero, and I did not need a single pain shot all night long.

Dave Fribush emphasizes that while the surgeon's warmth and compassion were helpful, the thing that made my pain suddenly disappear was the sudden disappearance of my negative feelings--intense anxiety about losing my teeth, as well as anger at feeling that I was being neglected. And the very moment my negative feelings changed, my anger disappeared as well.

My later research confirmed that negative emotions can, in fact, magnify the experience of physical pain, and that, on average, 50% of the pain we experience results from our negative emotions. This finding should provide hope for individuals struggling with physical pain, especially since this is a drug-free treatment not involving opiates.

if you want to reduce your negative feelings, one approach would be to read one of my books, like **Feeling Good or When Panic Attacks.**

<img class=" wp-image-14080 aligncenter" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/download-002.jpeg" alt="download (002)" width="70" height="113" />

They are, of course, not guaranteed to cure you, but research confirms that many people who read them do develop a more positive outlook on life and experience significant reductions in depression and anxiety. And the can be obtain inexpensively at Amazon or other book sellers.

* Does emotional trauma cause brain damage?
* Do you have to have a good cry when something traumatic happens?

### [172: Ask David: What's the Impact of Emotional Trauma on the Brain? And more](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/172-ask-david-whats-the-impact-of-emotional-trauma-on-the-brain-and-more)

Happy Holidays to everyone! Today's podcast is nestled between Hanukkah (on the 22nd) and Christmas Eve (on the 24th.) We send our warmest greetings to all of our listeners of all religious faiths.
Today, Rhonda, Dave and David discuss three questions you have submitted:
* Does emotional trauma cause brain damage?
* Do you have to have a good cry when something traumatic happens?
* Why does avoidance make anxiety worse?
**1. Is it true that emotional trauma affects the brain?**
Hi again Dr Burns,
I love the 5 secrets, and have had great success in my new job by implementing them! I keep listening to all the 5 secrets podcasts over and over to keep it fresh for me and really loved the podcast on advanced techniques.
My question today is about how trauma affects the brain. ‘Trauma’ is the new buzz word in education, and psychologists are creating presentations geared for teachers and other school professionals that claim the “trauma-affected brain” is altered and cannot learn as easily. They allege imaging technology can prove this.
Do you know if PTSD/trauma actually impacts a person’s ability to learn? I thought that it was the negative thoughts that interfere with attitudes toward learning, not an actual brain impairment.
Another term that is used frequently is “intergenerational trauma”, meaning if my parent experienced trauma, it could be passed down to me and therefore impact my ability to cope with life stressors. Any thoughts? Any credible research you are aware of?
In the Ask David, could you also include your opinion on how Adverse Childhood Experiences impact people's mental health and ability to cope?  There are a range of experiences cited in studies from moving around a lot in childhood to witnessing a murder to molestation.  After listening to your podcast episode 147 (Garry with PTSD) I was satisfied with the effectiveness of TEAM to treat trauma rapidly.  But then I remembered a documentary I had seen about 'feral children' who were extremely neglected as children, and I wondered if there are some cases where the psychology or potential of a person is forever impacted by an adverse childhood experience.  Your take?
All the best,
Jackie

**Answer**

David finds these buzzwords and buzz-theories somewhat misleading, and sometimes even pseudo-scientific. He has treated large numbers of patients struggling with the effects of severe trauma, and has found that trauma patients are usually the easiest to treat and the quickest to learn. David like to focus on rapid healing, using TEAM-CBT, rather than sending people the message that they are impaired, damaged or defective because of some emotionally traumatic experience.

In fact, nearly all humans have experienced quite a lot of traumatic events, which can range from mild to extreme. And lots of us have some degree of brain damage. My brain (David Burns) was squashed at birth, for example, and there are certain cognitive functions that I’m not very good at. For example, for some reason, I can't often find something that's right in front of me, and I have lots of trouble remembering names and faces.

I just try to accept my many shortcoming and work around them. The problem is rarely our flaws or imperfections, but rather the distorted negative messages we give ourselves; messages that generate anxiety, fear, inadequacy, shame, and so forth.

Of course, animals and humans with traumatic experiences at a young age, or any age, may struggle with fear and may seem, as you say, "feral." My wife and I (David) have adopted many feral cats, and have found that consistent warmth and love can lead to dramatic changes and the development of trust. We all have a history, and every person's story and suffering deserve respect and profound compassion.

**2. What’s displacement? Is it true that you have to have a good cry when something traumatic happens?**

Hi there again,

I've been practicing TEAM-CBT for a year while at the same time studying Dr. Gordon Neufeld's theories on the need for "tears of futility" for true healing (including adaptation, maturation and development of resilience). He states that if we only work on the cognitive level, we risk to just displace the symptoms in our clients and they would miss out on maturation and adaptation. I'm wondering if you have ever seen a displacement of the symptom in treating your patients with TEAM-CBT?

In most live sessions I've seen with you you seem to have this gift / skill to make it safe for the client to let the tears flow and that this often seem to be the moment when a breakthrough is about to happen. So I wonder if you think the client needs to shed tears or at least feel the feelings of futility or "true sadness" before we should move forward to methods (in addition to getting perfect empathy scores)? And what role you think tears play in the healing process?

Would love to hear your thoughts on this! (See my last e-mail if you want more details to why I'm asking.)

Thanks,

Warmly, Malena

**Answer**

I am really pleased to see that you, Malena, are a certified TEAM-CBT therapist in Sweden! I always love to hear from a fellow Swede!

You are right, Malena, that emotion is very important in therapy, since it shows that the patient trusts the therapist and is willing to be vulnerable. This is a critical part of the E = Empathy in TEAM-CBT. Therapy without emotion, without tears, may be overly technical, dry and almost "empty."

In addition, some patients do intellectualize as a way of avoiding emotions. I call this fear of negative emotions “Emotophobia.” I try to confront patients who do this in a gentle way. I might say, “Gee, Jim, I just asked you how you were feeling, and I notice that you didn’t really answer my question. Did you notice this as well?”

This technique is called Changing the Focus, and it has to be done in a kindly, non-threatening way. We discussed it on [a recent podcast](https://feelinggood.com/2019/09/16/158-changing-the-focus-one-of-the-advanced-secrets-of-effective-communication/) that was one of our most popular.

I’ve seen a patient recently who had incredible problems sharing his own feelings in interactions with his wife, and equally intense problems acknowledging her feelings. If a patient is determined to overcome this fear of his or her feelings, using the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Five-Secrets-Common-Errors-v-5.pdf), tremendous progress can be made, but the patient’s resistance has to be dealt with first.

Early in my career, I was aware of the idea that if you don’t cry when a traumatic event, like the loss of a loved one happens, that you are setting yourself up for emotional difficulties, so I often pushed my patients to cry. And occasionally this was very helpful.

But in general, I have not found it necessary to think that every patient **has** to cry, and it is definitely not true that crying during sessions is a panacea. During my residency training, I had many patients who cried constantly during therapy sessions without any improvement at all. They just kept crying and crying every session! You could even argue that this makes patients worse, because you continually activate and strengthen the same negative circuits in your brain.

When I learned cognitive therapy, I had many tools to help patients change their lives, and that's when I became to see far more improvement and recovery. The tears were helpful, but rarely or never curative.

If you are getting perfect empathy scores from your patients on the scales on the Evaluation of Therapy Session, Malena, you are doing great! Way to go!

David (a fellow Swede)

**3. Why does avoidance make anxiety worse?**

Hi Dr. Burns,

I love your show and work so much. I can't wait to buy "Feeling Great."

There's a question I've had for about three years that I've badly wanted to get my head wrapped around. It's in regard to something I've heard you say on a Feeling Good Podcast: "Most experts in exposure therapy or behavior therapy say that attempts to control your symptoms (of anxiety) is the cause of all anxiety." I have heard others say that too/

Why is this?

I understand if you push-through an anxiety you can learn whether it's warranted or not.

But how is trying to avoid an anxiety actually the cause of all anxiety?

I want to be able to understand it for when I feel myself trying to move away from social anxiety I can understand at a moment's notice why doing so actually is the cause of all my anxiety. To be able to skewer the rationalizations in my mind of why I shouldn't push-through.

Thank you David.

Best Regards,

Mark

**Answer**

Rhonda, David and Dave discuss why avoidance makes anxiety worse, and why exposure often leads to improvement or even complete recovery. David describes the incredible resurgence of his own fear of heights when he took his children on a camping adventure in Havasupai Canyon in Arizona one spring when he and his wife were living in Philadelphia, and he avoided climbing down a cliff he had climbed down many times when he was younger.

Anxiety is not caused by the thing you fear, but by your distorted thoughts and fantasies. When you pull back instead of confronting the monster, you do not get the chance to discover that the monster has no teeth, so your negative thoughts and fantasies can quickly spiral out of control.

We will see you again next week for our final podcast of 2019. Thanks for so many wonderful questions, and for your support during the past year. We have had more than 1.5 million downloads, thanks to you! We look forward to serving you again in 2020!

If you like the podcasts, please tell your family, friends, and neighbors. You are our marketing team! And if you are a mental health professional, you might be interested in my February workshop on therapeutic resistance with Dr. Jill Levitt. It's going to be a good one, and you can find the details below.

### [173: Dr. Amir Sabouri on the Human Side of Medicine](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/173-dr-amir-sabouri-on-the-human-side-of-medicine)

This will be our last podcast of 2019, so we wanted to make it something special. We also want to thank all of you for your support over the past year, and wish you all the very best in 2020!
Thanks to all of you, we surpassed 1.5 million downloads this year, and will likely hit 2 million in the spring of 2020. If you like the Feeling Good Podcasts, please tell your friends and family members, as word of mouth is our best marketing by far. In addition, if you are a member of any mailing lists, send them this link to [the list of all the Feeling Good Podcasts](https://feelinggood.com/list-of-feeling-good-podcasts/). On any given day, 30% of human beings are feeling depressed and / or anxious, so you'll be doing lots of  people a favor, since the podcasts, as you know, are entirely free.
We are joined today by Amir Sabouri, PhD, MD, a highly esteemed neurologist from Iran with extensive medical training in the United States in addition to his PhD research in molecular immunology in Japan. Amir specializes in the treatment of horrific neuromuscular disorders such as ALS (the dreaded Lou Gehrig's Disease) at one of our local Kaiser Hospitals here in the San Francisco Bay Area. In today's riveting and inspiring interview, Amir describes how he discovered that, in spite of his extensive technical training, his strongest and most effective medicine by far is sometimes a healing dose of humility and compassion, delivered with the Five Secrets of Effective Communication.
We are also joined by our wonderful host, Dr. Rhonda Barovsky, as well as my friend and neighbor, Dave Fribush, who has joined many of our podcasts recently, as well as Steve Reinhard, a certified coach and TEAM-CBT therapist who flew in from Colorado for the Sunday hike and podcasts. Steve will be the featured guest on next week podcast, along with his wife, Barbara, on the topic of "Sadness as Celebration."
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14716" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Amir-Steve-podcast-339368457-1571837467981.jpg" alt="Amir Steve podcast" width="4032" height="3024" />
Back row: Amir, David, Rhonda, and Dave Fribush. Front row: Steve and Barb
Amir and I have had a friendship and professional collaboration that goes back several years, when Amir first joined one my Sunday hikes, along with his wife, Dr. Sepideh Bajestan, PhD, MD, who was one of my students during her psychiatric residency at Stanford. In the past couple years, Amir has attended the Sunday hikes regularly and has worked hard to learn and master TEAM-CBT, especially the Five Secrets of Effective Communication, which have begun to play a huge role in his clinical and professional work.
Amir begins with a description of the first time he did personal work on one of the Sunday hikes.  At the time, Amir was struggling with feelings of sadness, guilt and inadequacy about his role as a physician and neurologist. That's because, in spite of his incredible background training and research in molecular immunology and neuromuscular pathology, the bottom line was that he had no cure to offer his many patients he had to diagnose with incurable diseases, such as ALS, and he confessed that he often felt like a failure in his attempts to help these unfortunate patients and their families.

However, by looking at his own negative thoughts, and pinpointing the distortions in them, he was able to challenge and crush those thoughts, and accept the incredible value of the immense caring and compassion he brought to his work with his patients. The change he experienced on that hike was quite pronounced, and was arguably his first "enlightenment." It was a very moving experience for me, too.

Next, Amir tackled the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf), and worked extremely hard to practice and master these techniques, which have also been invaluable in his medical work. He describes two recent patient encounters where these skills were invaluable. One involved an angry new patient who aggressively criticized Amir from the very moment he walked in the door. The many also criticized bitterly all the other doctors he'd seen. He complained that he didn't want to be there, that nobody could help, and that nobody cared about him.

Amir responded using the Five Secrets of Communication, empathizing and disarming hat the man was saying, and using "I Feel" Statements, Feeling Empathy, Stroking, and Inquiry as well. The man suddenly began to sob and share his deepest feelings throughout his entire encounter with Amir. At the end, Amir was concerned that he'd given him "nothing" other than his efforts at skillful listening using the Five Secrets, and was afraid the man might issue yet another complaint.

One hour later, Amir received a touching email from the patient, filled with praise and gratitude, and he said he felt hope for the first time! We talked about the paradox of "giving nothing," just listening with compassion, without trying to help or fix. and how this is often the greatest gift of all.

Amir also talked about his interaction with a young woman who suffered horrific complications from a powerful medication that Amir had prescribed for her neurologic problem, and Amir was flooded with guilt and fear, thinking that he had failed her and that he might get sued. But once again, his use of the Five Secrets transformed their interaction into a deeply meaningful connection.

We discussed how training in the Five Secrets should perhaps be mandatory for medical students, and residents as well, since rigorous training in communication with patients is not really a part of medical training, although the doctor patient relationship is, of course, given lip-service. Of course, we also strongly feel that Five Secrets training should be mandatory for all human beings!

I mentioned an experience I had as a medical student working in the medical outpatient clinic at Stanford under the direction of Dr. Allen Barbour, who wrote a beautiful book on the human side of medicine, [Caring for Patients](https://www.amazon.com/Caring-Patients-Critique-Medical-Model/dp/0804723893). I was assigned to a mailman who had been struggling with intractable angina, which is relentless chest pain due to problems with the blood supply to the heart. He was scheduled for one of the first open heart surgeries at Stanford. The idea was to improve the blood circulation to the heart, and the surgery was brand new and still somewhat experimental, and potentially quite risky.

While I was examining the patient, I had a hunch that something was "off," and asked the man if there were any problems in his life that were bothering him. This led to an unusual and unexpected set of events you can hear about on the podcast. Telling the story so many years later brought tears to my eyes.

After the podcast, Steve Reinhard, who had been in our "live audience" at the "Murietta Studios" today, began to cry and mentioned his own struggles with cancer. He told us how hard it has been for him to find compassionate doctors who seem to care, and how wonderful it would be if he could find a gentle, humble and loving doctor like Amir! We decided to edit Steve's comments into today's podcast as well.

High tech medicine is wonderful, and evolving rapidly, with new healing miracles every day. But the doctor's most powerful medicine, by far, is still the bedside manner, just as it has been for the last two thousand years.

The Five Secrets of Effective Communication can enrich your life, too, and can vastly improve your interactions with loved ones, friends, and colleagues. These tools can also make you more effective in the business world, or in any human interaction. Our world seems very troubled these days, to say the least, and we can all start some healing by changing the way we relate to others and learning to speak with our third "EAR," which stands for Empathy, Assertiveness, and Respect.

I hope that doesn't sound hopelessly corny, elderly, or demented, but if so, I will have to plead guilty as accused.

Thanks so much for tuning in today, and if you like these shows, please tell your friends!

If you would like to learn more about the Five Secrets, a great first step would be to read my book, [.](https://amzn.to/2YSDP64">Feeling Good Together</a><a href= "https://amzn.to/2KQBhLZ) Make sure you do the written exercises while you read, and make sure you practice as well!

[<img class= "alignnone wp-image-357" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/feelinggoodtogether.jpeg" alt="Feeling Good Together" width="103" height="157" />](https://amzn.to/2YSDP64)

On the right hand panel of every page on my website, www.feelinggood.com, you'll find a Search function. If you type in "Five Secrets" or "Relationships," you'll find many helpful podcasts on this topic as well.

Learning the Five Secrets takes lots of commitment and practice. It's like learning to play the piano or learning to play tennis. You'll have to work at it. Amir is incredibly brilliant, and he had to work at, too. If you're willing to do the same thing, the results can change your life, too!

All the best,

Amir, Rhonda, Dave, Steve, and David

### [174: Sadness as Celebration featuring Steve & Barbara Reinhard](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/174-sadness-as-celebration-featuring-steve-amp-barbara-reinhard)

People in the featured photo for today's podcast. Back row: Amir, David, Rhonda, and Dave. Front row: Steve and Barb
This will be our first podcast of 2020, so we wanted to make it a really good one!
Rhonda, Dave and I are very proud to welcome Steve Reinhard and his wonderful wife, Barb, on today’s podcast. Steve and Barbara flew in from Colorado to join the Sunday hike and do this podcast in the “Murietta Studios” following the hike. Steve is a former electrical contractor and lay minister, and is the first certified life coach to be admitted into the TEAM-CBT certification program at the Feeling Good Institute in Mt. View, Ca, (link).
The following is a heart-warming email I received from Steve prior to the show.

**Subject:** Re: looking forward

Hi David,

Woohoo! We are partners in crime! I'm feeling super comfortable now.

Thanks David for your generous invitation! I'm happy to jump on any of the 3 options you suggested for the show. I'd love to hear your stories, especially those of undistorted sadness where you celebrated with tears, aware of the suffering we folks tend to keep hidden.

I cry a lot these days, laugh a lot too. In that regard I'd love to have my own personal Ask David session. David, I love the old, demented, weak human guy, while admiring the pioneering, genius who teaches so clearly & humanly. My questions wouldn't be so much for me to learn or be taught but to connect with you. I'm crying as I write. As a listener I want to connect with the human, David. May or may not be something you want to do. We have loads to interact with.

Yep, I take a "spiritual " approach & would love to interact with you being anti-religious. Listeners might find this helpful & it sounds fun to me. A great opportunity for me to experience a death of the ego & the acceptance paradox which I have found liberating before I knew what it was called.

I'd love to talk about what it's like to be diagnosed with blood cancer and holey bones & some of the nutty things we say to each other when we don't know what to say. Empathy in the Five Secrets way is extremely rare from my distorted perspective. Aging & being willing to challenge the many shoulds & shouldn'ts that accompany things being different than they were last year would be fun to talk about.

I can't keep track of the # of times folks repeat "getting old is hell", same with cancer, vision problems, walking problems, drug side effects. I would love to hear your stories & experience as an old demented guy who can't walk as fast as he did a couple years ago.

Thanks for your generous invitation. I still find it surprising that I get to have this experience with you all. I'm really looking forward to today’s show.

Steve
We began the podcast with a discussion of the role of lay therapists in the field of mental health. Coaching is newly emerging field of counseling that does not require graduate work in psychiatry, psychology, social work, or counseling. In the past, coaches have not been permitted to enter the TEAM-CBT certification program. However, Dr. Angela Krumm, who is the head of the FGI certification program changed that policy specifically so that Steve—and now, other certified coaches as well--can be certified in TEAM-CBT, and I applaud this change.
The role of lay therapists has always been highly controversial. I can recall that when I was in college in the 1960s, there was a lively debate about so-called “lay psychoanalysts.” Previously, you had to be an MD to be a psychoanalyst, but over time, non-MDs were permitted to become psychoanalysts. To my way of thinking, this debate has always been more about power and the protection of territory than about skill or the capacity to heal.

Now we are seeing the same questions being raised about certified life coaches. In my experience, graduate training doesn’t always guarantee that someone will be a skillful therapist, and sometimes the opposite is true. In fact, in my experience, the LESS previous training therapists have, the easier they are to train in TEAM-CBT, because they don’t have so much training they have to “unlearn.” The Buddhists say that an empty cup is better than a full cup, because the full cup spills over when you try to pour the wine.

Of course, there’s a downside, too, since therapists can also be sometimes exploitative and can be hurtful to patients. This includes coaches as well as mental health professionals with graduate training.

Next, we asked Steve about the role of spirituality in his TEAM-CBT counseling, since he is a also a lay minister. I am convinced that the spiritual dimension can be important and powerful in therapy, and that at the moment of our deepest change, the change is not only psychological, emotional, and behavioral, but also spiritual, because we may suddenly “see” things from a much deeper perspective. Much in TEAM-CBT is easily integrated with spirituality. For example, the Acceptance Paradox is an inherently spiritual technique that can play an important role in recovery from depression and anxiety.

One of Steve’s motives I doing this podcast was to have his own Ask David session, and one of his questions was, “What is it like to be regarded by many people as a guru?” I described the blessings as well as the occasional curses and problems that come with this moniker!

Then the conversation turns to Steve’s devastating diagnosis of blood cancer—multiple myeloma—just over a year ago, and how hard and frustrating it has been for Steve to get people just to listen and provide support, including his doctors, and how incredibly meaningful it is when people express simple compassion and love.

Steve also talks about how he has decided to accept his cancer, and not to “fight it” or to go to war with his body. And acceptance does not mean refusing treatment—Steve is receiving chemotherapy for his multiple myeloma. The acceptance we are describing is more of a mind-set of peacefulness. We also talked about the fact that the problems of aging are not unique, but are simply the problems of living, problems we can encounter at any age. The whole basis of cognitive therapy is that our feelings result from our thoughts, and not the circumstances of our lives. This is a very optimistic message because we often cannot change the facts of our lives, but we can do a great deal to change the way we think and feel.

I ended the podcast by raising the question of “Sadness as Celebration.” I asked whether tears and feelings of sadness in response to the suffering of others might actually be one of the highest experiences a human being can have, and is perhaps the deepest meaning of spirituality. I described a somewhat bizarre experience I had on the Nevada desert when I was a Stanford medical student in the 1960s—it was an experience I have kept secret for nearly 50 years, and talk about for the first time on this podcast.

After the podcast, I emailed Rhonda to get her “take” on the show. Usually, we focus on specific techniques our podcast fans might want to learn. But this time, we just kind of were “hanging out” together, so I was concerned and feeling a bit self-critical. I was also concerned that I may have sounded like a loony at times on the show, since my personal story was perhaps over the top.

Here’s how Rhonda replied:

Hi David,

As I was listening to the Steve podcast, it struck me that it was really friends talking, getting to know each other, sharing stories and joking around and being serious sometimes. That's why I thought it was really lovely.

I listened to Steve's podcast after dinner. I loved it!

You are so charming, and tell sweet stories that open up your life to the listener. I think everyone will love how endearing you are.

Steve was articulate, vulnerable and open. While it's not an episode where you are teaching anything specific, it is a lovely podcast and I think regular listeners will love the opportunity to get to know you.

Rhonda

So, let us know what you think!

Thank you, Steve and Barbara, for your generous appearance on today’s show.

And we also thank YOU for tuning in today!

Rhonda and David

PS After the show, Rhonda and I got this great email from Steve:

Hi David and Rhonda,

Just getting back to communicating after a full & thrilling trip to California! Arrived home Monday evening, then off to Chemo center most of Tuesday & now regaining energy.

I like your show notes David—mucho.

Really enjoyed the hike, lunch, getting to sit in on Amir's podcast, then to interact with David, Barb, & Rhonda. Loved your stories, David, and the whole experience of tears and celebrating sadness. Oh yea, and the big kiss on the lips!

A lot of other ideas & questions have popped into my thinking since the podcast. One being that us Christians are pretty judgmental. This is supremely true, and is probably one of the best-selling points of religion that's kept hidden behind the smoke and mirrors.

It's so much fun to judge folks, look down on everyone else and have that feeling of moral superiority! Probably better than LSD I'm guessing.

What bugs me about "religion" most is how many folks suffer under the whip of having to improve and become better and jump over impossible standards. Of course, they could move on to the Acceptance Paradox and right into celebrating sadness in a split second if they wish.

What wonderful time it was with you all.

Feeling grateful to share life with each of you.

Love you,

Steve

### [175: What if I REALLY AM a useless human being? The Cure for Therapeutic Failure!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/175-what-if-i-really-am-a-useless-human-being-the-cure-for-therapeutic-failure)

Rhonda and David address a question from Karolina, a therapist in Poland who was failing with a depressed patient who felt totally convinced he was a “useless” human being. I think you will find their discussion of this case fascinating, as it deals with the cause of practically ALL therapeutic failure, and illustrates the solution al well, using TEAM-CBT methods and concepts.
Today’s podcast is intended for **therapists** and patients alike!
For the show notes, we are including the email David received from Karolina, as well as his initial response.
Dear Dr. Burns,
I've been listening to your podcast for 6 months now and it's been so helpful with my work as a therapist as well as in my personal life. I'm starting to develop a habit of considering every unwanted state with a "what does it say that's awesome about me?" and I'm much happier now :).
I'm wondering if you'd consider helping me some more. I have a client who's been struggling with depression for many years. At the moment he's doing ok and his mood is up. Lately the topic of his uselessness came up again and he's willing to work on that. He said he'll consider the possibility that he's not a useless human being and asked me to not to dismiss the possibility that he is - that's how he'll know that I'm not just trying to cheer him up.

It's been bugging me ever since. Although I've agreed, I really can't find in me any part that is ready to think that. I strongly believe he's not a useless person. I can't imagine labeling anyone in that way and in his case it feels so personal as I like him very much and I care about him.

I'm starting to have dreams about our next session when I fail him by trying to convince him to think as I do. How can I be open about our conclusion when my mind is already fixed? Any thoughts on this would be deeply appreciated.

Best wishes from Poland

Karolina
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Hi Karolina,
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Thanks! The term has no meaning. It is just a vague put down, like what a bully might say.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">I might ask him what time of day he was feeling useless, and then have him fill out a Daily Mood Log for that moment, step by step. We can only help him at one specific moment.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You can use a large number of techniques but must first get an A on Empathy, and then do effective paradoxical agenda setting, starting with the Paradoxical Invitation Step and then asking “what type of help would you be looking for?” then you can do the Magic Button and Positive Reframing.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">All of the negative thoughts and feelings on the Daily Mood Log will be advantageous and will show something about him that is awesome and positive. You should be able to generate a list of at least 25 overwhelming positives. Then you can use the Magic Dial.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">When you get to M = Methods, you can put the thought, “I am a useless human being” in the middle of a recovery circle, and then select a minimum of 16 methods to challenge it.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You can start with Identify the Distortions. There are likely at least 9 distortions in the thought, including AON, OG, MF, DP, MAG / MIN; ER; LAB; SH; SB.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You can try, “let’s define terms,” and ask what’s the definition of a “useless human being”? You’ll find that no matter how you try to define it,


<li style="list-style-type: none;"> 

* The definition will apply to all human beings.
* The definition will apply to no human beings.
* The definition does not apply to him.
* The definition does not make sense.
* The definition is based on some kind of arbitrary cut-off points.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You can do this as a role-play, being a close friend trying to find out if you’re useless, and asking him for guidance on how to find out.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You can do the Paradoxical Double Standard Techniques, Downward Arrow, Hidden Emotion, Externalization of Voices, Acceptance Paradox / Self-Defense Paradigm, Examine the Evidence, Semantic Method, and on and on.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The problem is NOT that he’s a “useless human being” but rather that he’s obsessing and wasting time on a meaningless construct, and beating up on himself.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The whole key to success will be agenda setting. You can take the position that maybe this is not something that he really wants to challenge, since it may be working for him, and also reflects all those 25 wonderful things about him.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The whole key to success will be agenda setting. You can take the position that maybe this is not something that he really wants to challenge, since it may be working for him, and also reflects all those 25 wonderful things about him. Remember that just about 99.9% of therapeutic failure results from Agenda Setting errors. Is this something you want to help him with, or something he is desperately asking you for help with? I am almost 100% positive that this is your agenda, not his. In fact, your need to “help” him with this may actually keep him stuck.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In fact, here is the proof. You write: “I'm starting to have dreams about our next session when I fail him by trying to convince him to think as I do. How can I be open about our conclusion when my mind is already fixed?”
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">If you don’t understand this, I recommend some supervision from a TEAM therapists or join one of the online classes, or attend my workshop on resistance, coming up in a month or so, check out my website workshop page for details. You can join online.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">David D. Burns, M.D.

Hi Dr. Burns,

Thank you so much for your quick and thorough response!

I kinda felt that my "helping" is the issue here as I've felt my own frustration rising...

Thanks for reminding me that uselessness is just a meaningless concept, I needed that. And I love the idea of role-playing as a friend asking for help with defining his uselessness. I'll pace myself, though, and give us time to walk through all the steps, especially Empathy and Agenda Setting and check how it goes and what my clients wants, not I.

I appreciate information on the resources and supervision I can access online, so good to know there are options!

You can use my real name, can't wait to hear the podcast :).

Karolina

Thanks for listening today! By the way, if you are looking for CE credits or training in TEAM-CBT, my upcoming workshop on therapeutic resistance on February 9, 2020 will be a good one. You'll learn how to use the techniques described in today's podcast.

### [176: My suicidal daughter refuses to talk with me / How can I deal with my jealousy?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/176-my-suicidal-daughter-refuses-to-talk-with-me-how-can-i-deal-with-my-jealousy)

 
**Rhonda and David discuss two challenging questions submitted by listeners like you.**<strong style= "color: var(--color-text);"> **
**Question #1: Cindy asks: My suicidal daughter refuses to talk to me! What can I do?**
**Comment:** Dear David,
I stumbled upon you teaching in another podcast a few months ago. Immediately I was stunned by how much your words echoed in my mind. I have listened to your book three times in Audible and many of your podcasts. You Changed my life!!!
I am much more relaxed now and I can sleep!!! I talked about you with my massage therapist and she bought your book for her daughter (who has anxiety attacks) and her niece. Her daughter is an aspiring artist who said that she would buy your book and give them away to teens when she becomes famous.
I now ask you to change another life, that of my daughter's. She has been depressed for more than 20 years, suicidal (bought a noose, watches suicide movies, talked about ways to kill herself) and no therapists could help. We went to therapy together this past summer and it only ended that she abruptly canceled and is no longer responding to me by any means: phone, text, card, or email. The last time I saw her was late August and she was very down and had very poor personal hygiene. I have since sent her a loving text at least every other day, I offer to drive to her city (an hour away) to have dinner with her, I sincerely apologized for everything I could think of that I have done wrong since she was a child, I sent gifts to her by mail, I invite her to come for holidays, I ask her cousins to call (she did respond to them). No response to me at all. I am wondering how to communicate with a loved one who just totally shut you off.
Always your fan,
Cindy
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">Thank you, Cindy. Sorry to hear about your daughter, very concerning. My heart goes out to you. Our own daughter had a rough time as a teenager, too, but now is doing great. I hope things evolve with your daughter, too.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">This podcast may help: [https://feelinggood.com/2019/10/28/164-how-to-help-and-how-not-to-help/](https://feelinggood.com/2019/10/28/164-how-to-help-and-how-not-to-help/) as well as this one:

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The first podcast highlights common errors in trying to “help” someone who is hurting, and emphasizes how to respond more effectively, using the Five Secrets of Effective Communication.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The second podcast illustrates how to get people to open up using one of the advanced secrets called “Multiple Choice Empathy / Multiple Choice Disarming.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">My book, **Feeling Good Together**, explains these techniques in detail, with practice exercises, and includes an entire chapter on how to talk to someone who refuses to talk to you. You can learn more on my book page. ([https://feelinggood.com/books/](https://feelinggood.com/books/)). Some support from a mental health professional might also be helpful to you, as these techniques sound simple, but are actually challenging to master.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">Your daughter might also benefit from my book, **Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy** ([https://feelinggood.com/books/](https://feelinggood.com/books/)). It is not a substitute for treatment from a mental health professional, but research studies indicate that more than 60% of the people who read it improve significantly in just four weeks. It is inexpensive, and I’ve linked to it if you want to take a look.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">All the best,
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">David
**Question #2:** <strong style= "color: var(--color-text);">Lorna asks: How can I deal with my jealousy?**

**Comment:** Hi David,

I've recently discovered your books and your podcast and CBT has really been helping me in my personal life. I really want to thank you for all the amazing work you do!!

The issue I'm having however seems to still really get my moods down and I was wondering if perhaps you could offer some general advice via the podcast.

I'm in a great relationship but the ex-girlfriend of my partner has recently moved back to the city where we live and now we are in similar social circles. They were together for a very long time and now I'm really struggling with the prospect of spending time with her.

When we all spend time together, it’s actually fine, but afterwards I really struggle with thinking about them together, getting to know her and thinking about her personality and how we compare.

I think most people would find this uncomfortable, but it really has triggered a downward spiral for me. My partner and I argued about it and I struggle to let things go that were said in arguments.

Do you have any advice on dealing with a situation of an ex-partner being on the scene and perhaps how to not dwell on things that were said during arguments?

Thanks,

Lorna
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Hi Lorna,
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Thanks, might work. What does this mean: “Do you have any advice on dealing with a situation of an ex-partner being on the scene and perhaps how to not dwell on things that were said during arguments?”
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The rest of the email seems to suggest feelings of jealousy, insecurity, and so forth, as if she is a threat to your current relationship. is this correct?
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">David

Hi David,

Thanks so much for getting back to me!

I don't actually think she is a threat to our relationship, and don't feel that they have feelings anymore for each other, but it just makes me super uncomfortable to think about how long they spent together.

I'm always comparing our relationship to what I think their relationship was like in the past. I know I should stop thinking about those things but I really struggle to stop!

I know my partner and I are very much in love but I keep having thoughts like
* “It’s not fair that I have to spend time with her,” or
* “I feel really guilty because he wants to be friends with her but can't due to how I feel about the situation.”
I also feel like he blames me.

I was hoping you could shed some light on what you think in general is a good strategy for dealing with situations where an ex-girlfriend/boyfriend of your partner is on the scene and you all have to spend time together.

I do have feelings of jealousy and insecurity but I struggle to understand why as I don't believe they want to be together anymore at all.

We had a few arguments about it initially where he said things like “you are just angry that I have an ex-girlfriend” or “what's the big deal about it all?”

I was so hurt by the way he made my feelings seem petty and trivial. We have both apologized but I keep remembering what he said and how hurt it made me feel.

Do you have any advice on letting go of past arguments when the 'problematic situation' (ex-girlfriend being around) is still on-going?

Thank you so much!

Lorna

David and Rhonda discuss this question, and include <span style= "color: var(--color-text);">David’s story in</span> <em style= "color: var(--color-text);">Intimate Connections** <span style= "color: var(--color-text);">as a medical student when David had a broken jaw and the ex-boyfriend of Judy, the girl he was living with in Palo Alto, charged into his house with a tough-looking friend and demanded to see Judy. David called the police, and the two fellows left and set, "we're going to get you!" David was terrified, since his jaw was still broken, and got some jaw-dropping advice</span> <span style= "color: var(--color-text);">the advice from his buddy, Sergio. You will be surprised to hear about what happened next!</span>

In addition to learning to "let go" of jealousy, Rhonda and David discuss many additional strategies for dealing with jealousy, including:


* Use of Self-Disclosure
* Positive Reframing: do you really want to give up your jealousy and vigilance?
* Cost-Benefit Analysis: Is it worth the hassle of constantly being suspicious, as opposed to simply deciding to trust and let the chips fall here they may?
* Downward Arrow: What are you the most afraid of? 

* Love Addiction
* Fear of Rejection
* Fear of Being Alone

* Overcoming the fear of being alone and the “need” for this man’s love, or any man’s love, is discussed in the first section of **Intimate Connections.**
* Exposure: You could fantasize the two of them together, making yourself as anxious and jealous as possible, until the feelings diminish and disappear.
* Self-Monitoring: Counting your thoughts about them on a wrist counter or cell phone for four weeks. David describes his work with an intensely jealous law student after his girlfriend broke up with him so she could date another fellow in his class.
* Understand the frequent ineffectiveness of apologizing, and why it doesn’t work! This is really important. David describes a powerful vignette about a troubled couple, where “I’m sorry” was CLEARLY a way of saying “shut up, I don’t want to feel about how hurt and angry you feel.” The Five Secrets of Effective Communication are a vastly more effective way of dealing with negative feelings. David and Rhonda contrast effective vs. dysfunctional “apologizing.”
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">While it can be important to say "I'm sorry," this formulaic response is usually insufficient because it often ends the conversation but the difficult or hurtful feelings remain.

### [177: Our Beloved Fabrice returns! New Psychedelic Research!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/177-our-beloved-fabrice-returns-new-psychedelic-research)

**Rhonda, Fabrice, and David discuss psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, Fabrice’s wonderful new marriage, his fascinating new podcast (**[http://peaceatlast.us/](http://peaceatlast.us/)**), and more.**
David and Rhonda are thrilled to have our beloved friend and colleague, Dr. Fabrice Nye, as the special guest on today’s podcast. Many of you will remember Fabrice as the man who gave birth to the Feeling Good Podcast, and acted as host for the first 133 podcasts.
Fabrice describes many events since he turned over the reins to Rhonda earlier this year, including his recent marriage and move to the beautiful but fire-ravaged Russian River area roughly 100 miles north of San Francisco. However, Fabrice still maintains his clinical practice on a part time basis in Redwood City, in the San Francisco Bay area.
The main focus of today’s podcast is Fabrice’s participation in promising new research on the treatment of PTSD. The participants in the study are veterans receiving psychotherapy that is assisted by treatment with MDMA during extended treatment session. MDMD is also known as the party drug, Ecstasy. However, the MDMA used in the research is chemically pure, whereas Ecstasy is generally obtained on the street and may not be pure.

Fabrice describes MDMA as an “empathogen” that makes people more loving and more in touch with their emotions. This can make it easier for patients with PTSD to talk about their traumatic experiences and painful feelings, which people with PTSD usually try to avoid. Avoidance makes all forms of anxiety much worse, where as exposure is usually beneficial.

Patients in the study received three treatment sessions, and a preliminary analysis indicated that one third of them improved to the point that they no longer had symptoms severe enough to be diagnosed with PTSD. Further studies are in progress, including a study with a control group, as well as follow-up studies to find out whether the improvement continued and whether some of the patients relapsed.

Fabrice also describes the fascinating new trend in treatment of a variety of conditions with psychedelics, including psilocybin, mescaline, and ayawauska. I expressed my personal support for this trend, as these substances have been used by hundreds, if not thousands of years, for spiritual purposes by indigenous people throughout the world.

And perhaps the coolest thing we learned was that Fabrice will be starting his own terrific podcast entitled PeaceAtLast.us about the time today’s podcast will be published. PeaceAtLast.us will focus on the overlap between spirituality and psychotherapy, a topic that I have always found extremely interesting and helpful in my own clinical work using TEAM-CBT. You might want to check out the new Fabrice podcast! I know that Rhonda and I will!

After the podcast, we received the following email from Fabrice, which includes many resources for those of you wanting more information about psychedelics and psychotherapy, as well as his new podcast.

### [178: Social Anxiety Be Gone! The Awesome Atlanta TEAM Therapy Demonstration!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/178-social-anxiety-be-gone-the-awesome-atlanta-team-therapy-demonstration)

In today’s podcast, Rhonda and David are honored to interview Dr. Michael Greenwald, a courageous clinical psychologist who helped make the Atlanta Intensive a truly amazing event. Michael volunteered for the live demonstration to work on his lifelong problem with social anxiety, which seems to be a popular topic these days, and likely a personal problem for many podcast fans.
My co-therapist was Thai-An Truong, a highly respected TEAM therapist and TEAM therapy trainer from Oklahoma City. Thai-An also joins today’s podcast via Zoom and dialogues with Michael for the first time since the intensive.
The session with Michael was powerful and inspiring, with a good 50% of the audience in tears (of joy) at the end. Michael recorded the session on his cell phone, but the quality was not up to the quality of our podcast recordings, so he agreed to fly up to the “Murietta Studios” from his home in Los Angeles so we could at least describe what happened and share the magic with you. If we can find a way to do some sound enhancement on the cellphone recording of the session, we will likely publish it as a separate mid-week podcast for those who like to hear the incredible therapeutic process unfolding in real time.
If you review [Michael’s Daily Mood Log](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Michael-Daily-Mood-Log-v-1.pdf) at the start of the session, you’ll see that he was feeling depressed, anxious, ashamed, worthless, lonely, self-conscious, discouraged and stuck, and all of these feelings were intense. In addition, he told us that he wasn’t feeling much joy, self-esteem, pleasure or satisfaction in his life.
But the strongest feeling was anxiety. He said that coming up on stage to face his fears was an enormous challenge, and that this was the first time he’d ever done something like this. We will do T = Testing again at the end to see what changed, and by how much. We’ll also ask Michael to complete the Empathy and Helpfulness surveys, so we can find out how he experienced Thai-An and David during the session.
You may be saddened by the upsetting event Michael recorded [at the top of his Daily Mood Log](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Michael-Daily-Mood-Log-v-1.pdf), which was “sitting with my son and trying to make conversation with him.” He said their conversations were always pretty superficial, and that he would typically leave the room after short interactions with his son because he felt so anxious.
Here’s an example of a typical exchange. Michael’s son, a graduate student in clinical psychology, was working on his applications to internship programs.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Michael: What’s up?
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Son: I’m working on my applications to internship programs.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Michael: That’s good. How’s it going? Are you getting them in on time?
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Son: Yah, it’s fine.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Michael: Are you completing them? Do you want me to look at them?

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Son: All fine.

If you review the negative thoughts on [Michael’s Daily Mood Log](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Michael-Daily-Mood-Log-v-1.pdf), you’ll see that he felt like a failure as a father because he did not know how to get close to his son or how to tell him just how much he loved him. He was telling himself things like this:
* Something is wrong with me because I can’t talk to him. 100%
* I am failing him as a father. 100%
* He deserves so much better than me. 100%
* He must wish he had a different father. 95%
* And more.
I was sad to see that Michael had been beating up on himself pretty badly for years, and I'm pretty sure that the therapists in the audience felt the same way, because it was so clear that he was a tremendously humble, giving and loving father who was totally devoted to his sons. I found myself thinking, "My gosh, I wish I'd been half the father that Michael is!"

The E = Empathy phase of the session lasted about 30 minutes. Michael indicated that Thai-An and I had done a good job, and that he felt understood and accepted, so we went on to A = Assessment of Resistance in a step-by-step manner, using these tools:
* The “Invitation Step” to find out if he was ready to roll up his sleeves and get to work on his social anxiety
* The “Miracle Cure” question to find out what he hoped would happen in the session
* The “Magic Button,” to see if he’d want all of his negative thoughts and feelings to disappear suddenly, just by pushing it
* “Positive Reframing,” asking Michael these two questions about each negative thought or feeling:


<li style="list-style-type: none;"> 

* “What does this negative thought or feeling show about you and your core values that’s positive and awesome?”
* “What are some benefits, or advantages, of this negative thought or feeling?”

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">At first, these questions didn’t make any sense to Michael, since he was so used to thinking about his negative thoughts and feelings in a negative light, thinking they were “bad” and were the result of some kind of personality defect or mental disorder, like “social anxiety disorder” described in the DSM5. This is also the hardest part of TEAM-CBT for therapists to learn, because it is so anti-intuitive.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">But as the [ list of positives](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Michael-Positive-Reframng-Table-v-1.pdf) grew, Michael began to “get it,” and we could actually see his mood lightening up before our very eyes. It was so cool, and this was the first hint the audience had that something remarkable was afoot. This, for sure, is one of the most powerful and innovative components of TEAM-CBT.
* The “Pivot Question” and “Magic Dial” Question. Michael decided it wouldn’t be such a great idea to press the Magic Button, since then all of the positives on the Positive Reframing list would go down the drain along with his negative thoughts and feelings.
He decided, instead, to dial down his negative feelings to much lower levels that would allow him to feel better without losing any of the positives. You can see this on [the “% Goal” column of his DML](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Michael-Daily-Mood-Log-v-2.pdf)

For example, he decided that it would be desirable to dial his depression down from 85% to 20%, since some sadness was appropriate, given his difficulties getting close to his son. In fact, if his depression disappeared completely, it would be like saying he didn’t really care. Michael decided to dial down the rest of his negative feelings as well in the range of 5% (for discouraged and stuck) to 15% (for anxiety), and 10% for the rest of his negative feelings.

This ended the A = Assessment of Resistance phase of the session, and that took about 25 minutes.

We then went on to M = Methods, focusing on his negative thoughts, one at a time, and attacking them with a variety of techniques like Identify the Distortions, Externalization of Voices, Acceptance / Self-Defense Paradigms, Examine the Evidence, and the Paradoxical Double Standard Technique.

At the end, we went into the audience so Michael could ask participants if they were judging him, and what they thought about him as a father. This is called the Survey Technique, and it is usually pretty threatening to people with social anxiety, or any of us, really! But as you’ll hear in the podcast, the feedback he received was jaw-dropping.

Thai-An joined us at the end and dialogued with Michael about the loneliness he’d struggled with, as well as how he could most effectively share his feelings of love and insecurity with his son. His “homework” after the session was to call his son and report back to all of us the next morning!

The next morning, Michael reported that he’d had the most phenomenal dialogue ever with his son! He was practically floating on air, and reports that after the intensive, his life has changed dramatically in many ways, including:
* A terrific relationship with his son.
* Feelings of true joy, even ecstasy, that he’d never previously experienced or even thought possible.
* Way better connections with people in general, due to being open and vulnerable for the first time.
* Greatly improved clinical experiences as a result of using TEAM-CBT in his clinical work. In fact, he is thinking of starting a free weekly TEAM-CBT practice group in the Los Angeles area, and hopefully opening a Feeling Great treatment center somewhere down the line. Make sure you contact Michael if you are interested joining his weekly practice group. ([drmichaeldg@gmail.com](mailto:drmichaeldg@gmail.com))
You can see his amazing mood scores at the end of the session on [his final DML](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Michael-Daily-Mood-Log-v-3.pdf). He also gave us perfect scores on the Empathy and Helpfulness scales, and described his experience as a “transformation.”

After the session, he added that he’d seen that people really could improve quickly during other live demonstrations at my workshops, but felt skeptical that a TEAM session could trigger joy, even euphoria, as he’d never actually felt those kinds of feelings. But now, he realized this was actually possible!

I would like to thank Michael, as well as my amazing co-therapist, Thai-An Truong. Thai-An is located in Oklahoma City and specializes in treating post-partum depression with TEAM-CBT. She also does one-on-one case consultation as well as awesome online TEAM training for mental health professionals, including free weekly webinars as well as her “TEAM-CBT bootcamp intensives.” If you would like to contact Thai-An, she can be reached at Thai-An Truong [thaian@lastingchangetherapy.com](mailto:thaian@lastingchangetherapy.com).

After the show was recorded, I received this amazing email from Michael. I think you'll enjoy it!
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Dr. Burns,
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Just some additional thoughts I'd like to mention about the changes I've noticed since the Atlanta therapy demo. The ones you put in the show notes are totally accurate. But the positive changes I've experienced since the demo go way beyond those. I'm not writing this to suggest you include these; I'm great with what you wrote. I only wanted to elaborate a bit on how things have been for me because it's such an incredible change for me. Please feel free to add to the notes, or not, at your discretion. And by the way, we are now two months post-demo and my mood scores remain essentially at zero with high positive feelings.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">My stress tolerance has increased a great deal. Prior to the demo, when I made a mistake or did something stupid, I would rip into myself with intensely harsh criticism and self-judgment (I think I shared with you about the time I dropped the bottle of Cologne as one example showing the different reactions to myself). Now, when the same sorts of things happen, those harsh voices are absent or merely a whisper, and easily dismissed. So there is no accompanying self-hatred like before. I'm far more outgoing with people in general. I feel closer than ever to my friends and family. I've been more present and available to my friends and family. I'm more open and far less defensive than I've ever been in my life. I feel more positive feelings than ever, and I laugh more than ever. I have more compassion for others as well as for myself. I'm more aware of my emotional world and have more access to my feelings. I'm able to connect more with others in general. The types of situations that would trigger feelings of irritability or anger, no longer do. I'm more able to be available for others, whether in my personal or professional life. I'm closer with my wife, and, honestly, with everyone in my family and social circle. I've been in several social gatherings since the demo, and my levels of anxiety have never been lower, and my level of engagement and participation has never been higher; I'm like a different person. I'm more optimistic and hopeful than before.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">So I know this is a bit of rambling, but I just wanted to mention these things. As I  had discussed with you during our visit, I've been struck by how far-reaching the benefits of the therapy demo have been for me. We focused on the one moment of one problem on the DML. We blew away those negative thoughts and feelings. That outcome, had it been limited to that specific target, would have been amazing and a total success for me. But as per your model, that was a 'fractal'. And the change in the brain circuits happened with that fractal and the new networks were created, and I feel that they continue to grow. For me, it's truly been the opposite of the drop of ink in the glass of water, discoloring everything, as a distorted thought or belief will do. The therapy demo was the drop of 'clarity' that shined the light on all my distorted thoughts and beliefs at one time. Maybe that's corny, but this is what it feels like to me.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">So feel free to use or not use any of this as you see fit. I only wanted to mention these things. There's more, but I think this gives the flavor. Thanks again.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Love,

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Michael

Thanks for listening today! By the way, if you are looking for CE credits or training in TEAM-CBT, my upcoming workshop on therapeutic resistance on February 9, 2020 will be a good one. You'll learn how to use the techniques described in today's podcast.

### [179: My Husband is Leaving Me. I Think He Needs Help!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/179-my-husband-is-leaving-me-i-think-he-needs-help)

Rhonda and David are joined today by Dr. Michael Greenwald, who was in the studio following his recording of last week’s podcast. We address a fascinating question submitted by a podcast fan:
**Sally asks” “How can I help my depressed husband who is leaving me?”**
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Hello Dr David,
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">My husband is going through severe depression and anxiety. He blames me frequently for all the bad decisions he made, and he says he married the wrong woman.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">He regrets almost every decision he made and says he made the decision [to marry me] under my pressure. Our marriage of 20 years is almost leading to separation.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">I don’t want to separate, but I don’t know how I can improve the situation. He doesn’t want to go to any doctor.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Do you think if I decide to go to TEAM certified therapist, they can work on me to get him out of his depression? If yes, how many sessions will it take?
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sally
David, Rhonda and Michael discuss this sad and difficult situation that Sally describes. Feeling loved and cared about is vitally important to nearly all of us, and when an important relationship is threatened, it can be extremely painful.

It sounds like Sally's husband may be on the verge of leaving her. David describes a powerful and paradoxical strategy he described in [Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy](https://amzn.to/2z7FZPS), that he has often used to help abandoned wives. The approach is the opposite of "chasing," and is based on experimental research on the most effective ways of shaping the behavior of rats!

It also sounds like Sally and her husband have some significant difficulties communicating in a loving and supportive way, like nearly all couples who are not getting along, and certainly some couples therapy or consultation might be a useful step. However, the prognosis for couples therapy isn't terribly positive unless both partners are strongly committed to each other, and willing to work on their own problems, as opposed to trying to change or “fix” the other person.

We place a strong emphasis on the Five Secrets of Effective Communication, especially the listening skills, when criticized by a patient, family member, colleague, or just about anyone. If Sally committed herself to learning to use these skills—which are NOT easy to learn—she might be able to develop a more loving and satisfying relationship with her husband, whether or not they separate or stay together. David expresses the opinion that her fixation on “helping” or “fixing” him might be misguided, and might actually irritate him and drive him away.

Rhonda, Michael and David illustrate David’s “Intimacy Exercise,” which is a way of learning to use the Five Secrets, and they practice with three of the criticisms Sally has heard from her husband:


* “You pressured me into marrying you.”
* “You’re to blame for all the bad decisions I’ve made.”
* “I married the wrong woman.”
After each exchange, the person playing Sally’s role receives a grade (A, B, C, etc.) along with a brief analysis of why, followed by role-reversals. These role play demonstrations might be interesting and useful for you, too, because you’ll see how this exercise works, and your eyes will also be opened to just how challenging it can be to respond to a painful criticism in a skillful way, and how mind-blowing it is when you do it right. You will also see that trained mental health professionals often make mistakes when learning these skills, and how you can increase your skills through this type of practice.

David emailed Sally with some additional resources that could be helpful to her.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">Hi Sally,
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">Thank you so much for your question, and for giving us the permission to read and discuss your question on a podcast. We will, however, change your name to protect your identity.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">For referrals for treatment, you can check the referral page on my [Feeling Good Institute](http://www.feelinggood.com">website</a>,  or go to the website of the <a href= "http://www.feelinggoodinstitute.com). There may be some excellent therapists in your area, too.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">I would recommend the recent Feeling Good Podcast on [“How to Help, and How NOT to Help.”](https://feelinggood.com/2019/10/28/164-how-to-help-and-how-not-to-help/) . The idea is that listening is sometimes far more effective and respectful than trying to “help” someone who is angry with you.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">Also, the podcasts on the Five Secrets of Effective Communication, starting with [Feeling Good Together](https://feelinggood.com/2017/12/04/065-five-secrets-training-enjoy-greater-intimacy/"> #65</a>, could be helpful, along with my book, **<a href= "https://amzn.to/2YSDP64)**. There’s also search function on almost every page of my website, and if you type in “Five Secrets,” you’ll get a wealth of free resources.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">Your husband might benefit from my book, **F[eeling Good: The New Mood Therapy](https://amzn.to/2z7FZPS))**, available on Amazon for less than $10. Research studies indicate that more than 50% of depressed individuals improve substantially within four weeks of being given a copy of this book, with no other treatment. However, the depressed individual must be looking for help, and it’s not clear to me whether the treatment is more your idea, or his idea.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">You seem to be asking for training in how to treat your husband. Perhaps, instead, you could learn to respond to him more skillfully and effectively using the Five Secrets. Learning how to do psychotherapy requires many years of training, and since he is not asking you for treatment or for help, that plan does not seem likely to be effective, at least based on what I know.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">In fact, trying to “treat” someone who is clearly annoyed with you runs the danger of creating more tension and anger, but this is not consultation, just general teaching. You would have to consult with a mental health professional for suggestions. Obviously, we cannot treat you or make any meaningful treatment recommendations in this context.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">But there is no doubt in my mind that there are many things you can do to improve the way you communicate with him and relate to him, if that would interest you. But this would require looking at your own role in the relationship, as well as lots of hard work and practice to learn to use the Five Secrets.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">Sincerely,

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">David D. Burns, M.D.

Thanks for listening to today's podcast!

### [180: Feeling Great: The Book and the App!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/180-feeling-great-the-book-and-the-app)

Rhonda and David are joined today by Jeremy Karmel who is working with David on a new Feeling Great app.
Rhonda begins by reading several amazing emails from fans whose lives have been changed by the podcasts as well as David’s books, including Jessica, Tim, and Mike. Thank you, everyone, for such kind and thoughtful comments!
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15933" src= "https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rhonda-2.jpg" alt="Rhonda 2" width="640" height="960" />
This great photo of Rhonda is courtesy of [Nancy Mueller,](https://www.nancymuellerphotography.com/About) a local photographer who kindly took some pics at my home in Los Altos, California.
David describes his upcoming book, **Feeling Great**, which will be released in September of 2020. It will move well beyond his first book, Feeling Good: **The New Mood Therapy**, all will incorporate all of the latest hi-speed treatment techniques in TEAM-CBT (aka “Feeling Great Therapy.”) David describes his excitement about the team he is working with to publish his latest book, including Linda Jackson at PESI (the publishing company), and Jenessa Jackson, his editor.
Jeremy describes why he approached David to develop a Feeling Great app. As a Stanford student, he was depressed and had to drop out of school for semester. Antidepressants and talk therapy had done nothing for him, so he was feeling hopeless.
Then Jeremy discovered one of Dr. Burns’ students, [Dr. Matthew May](http://MatthewMayMD.com), and recovered in just two weeks, which was mind-blowing. Matt was one of the first practitioners in the world to use the new TEAM-CBT, Jeremy felt a tremendous drive to make these powerful new techniques available to people around the world.

David and Rhonda, of course, share this goal! In fact, Rhonda has recently gone to Mexico City as well as India to support the sudden and strong emergence of TEAM-CBT in those countries.

Rhonda asks Jeremy many questions about the amazing recovery he experienced in his work with Dr. May, and how he’s been doing since. Then Rhonda, Jeremy, and David address a number of intriguing questions about the new app. For example, there is tremendous evidence from research that David’s first book, **Feeling Good**, has significant antidepressant effects. In fact, many published studies have confirmed that more than 50% of depressed individuals will recover or improve dramatically within four weeks if you just give them a copy of the book.

Is it possible that an app that incorporates all the great methods in **Feeling Good**, plus all the new techniques in TEAM-CBT, could be even more effective? And if so, would this mean that an electronic app could even outperform human therapists as well as antidepressant medications?

David says that this has been his dream for more than 40 years, and he thinks this is a definite possibility. Jeremy agrees, since the app, now in creation, has the potential to be far more powerful and systematic than reading a book or even going to a therapist.

Rhonda asks: "Are you trying to put human therapists out of business?"

David believes that there will always be a place for human therapists, since the person to person support and connection is invaluable and desperately needed.

However, the Feeling Great app can actually be a friend of human therapists, just as his book, **Feeling Good**, has been, working hand in hand with therapists helping to accelerate the recovery of their patients.

In addition, the app can bring rapid help and relief to millions of people worldwide who cannot afford therapy, and those who simply cannot find effective therapy. David emphasizes the goal of having an entirely free version of the app for people without resources.

Rhonda asks: "Will you be doing research as well as self-help “treatment” with the new app?"

The answer to that is absolutely, yes, and the implications for incredible research into the causes and treatments for depression, anxiety and relationship problems are immense, especially if thousands or even tens of thousands of individuals use the Feeling Great app.

For example, David has developed many psychological assessment instruments to help therapists and patients alike, but the costs and time required to develop and validate even a single short test can be substantial. In contrast, one might get more than enough data to evaluate a new instrument in just one day, which is mind-boggling.

In addition, every time someone uses the app, we will learn more and more about what works, and what does not. This type of analysis is vitally important, but practically impossible, or at the very least arduous and confusing, when working with human therapists, due to the complexity of what’s happening, and the intense bias of therapists and researchers alike. The computer, by way of contrast, does not mind being wrong and moving in different and more promising directions!

Rhonda, Jeremy and David will let all of you know when a beta version of the new app, is available, and hopes that many of you will try it out and let us know what you think! David will also let you know when pre-ordering for his new book, **Feeling Great** will be available as well!

David and Rhonda

Thanks for listening to today's podcast!

David

### [181: LIve Therapy with Sarah: Shrinks are Human, Too!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/181-live-therapy-with-sarah-shrinks-are-human-too)

In my workshops and weekly training group for community therapists at Stanford, we often include personal work as a part of the training. The personal work can help in several ways:


* When you’ve successfully done your own personal work, you will feel greater joy and energy in your personal life and in your clinical work as well.
* You will have a much deeper understanding of how TEAM-CBT actually works.
* You will be able to deliver faster and deeper therapy to your patients.
* You’ll be able to tell your patients, “I know how you feel, because I’ve been there myself. And what a joy it’s going to be to show you the way out of the woods, too!”
* Those who observe the therapy develop a greater understanding of how the fine points of effective therapy.
* When the person in the “patient” role has a profound change, we all share that joy and feel inspired by the miracles that can often be accomplished in a relatively short period of time. As they say, “seeing is believing.”
Rhonda recently surveyed some of our listeners about live therapy we sometimes offer on our podcasts—do you prefer to have the live therapy presented all at once, in an extended, two-hour podcast, or split up over two or more podcasts with expert commentary along the way?
Our listeners were split on this. So today we are presenting an actual and dramatic therapy session in its entirely. If you don’t have two hours to listen all at once, you can stop after an hour or so, and then return to the last portion when you have more time.
And please let us know what you think of this live therapy podcast format!

In today’s session, we are very grateful to Sarah, a certified TEAM-CBT therapist, for allowing us to share her very personal and powerful session with you. Sarah was having intense anxiety during her sessions with patients, and her anxiety was bordering on panic.

This is actually not unusual. In my experience, most shrinks struggle with feelings of insecurity from time to time. But when we shrinks experience insecurities, we often feel strong shame as well, telling ourselves that we “should” have it all together because we are supposedly “experts.”

I’m no exception! I can remember how anxious I used to feel on Sundays when I was starting out in private practice. I’d tell myself, “Wow, I’m going to have all of these high-powered patients tomorrow, and what if they notice that I don’t actually know what I’m doing half of the time!?”

But then, halfway through Monday morning, it would dawn on me that my patients didn’t seem to notice or care about my flaws, and I’d relax!

Although Sarah brought a Daily Mood Log to the session, listing all of the negative thoughts that were triggering her anxiety, along with many other intense negative feelings, the session took an unexpected turn in the direction of the Hidden Emotion Model.

We’ve done several podcasts on this powerful technique before, and now you have the chance to see how it works first-hand! Instead of challenging Sarah’s negative thoughts, as we usually do, we asked whether there was something bothering Sarah that she wasn’t telling us about, due to her arguably excessive “niceness.”

I think you’ll enjoy listening, and you may learn a little, too! My co-therapists for this session included Dr. Rhonda Barovsky, my beloved and brilliant podcast host, as well as Kevin Cornelius, MFT, a fabulous TEAM therapist whom I’ve recently featured in a recent blog!

Rhonda and I want to thank you, Sarah, once again, for your tremendous courage and generosity!

### [182: Ask David-Are Negative and Positive Distortions Bad? Treating an Existential Crisis. Agreeing with Unfair Criticisms](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/182-ask-david-are-negative-and-positive-distortions-bad-treating-an-existential-crisis-agreeing-with-unfair-criticisms)

Today, Rhonda and David answer three great questions submitted by listeners like you.


* I am confused about the terms, negative and positive distortions. Help!
* “How do you treat an “existential crisis?”
* Can you use the Five Secrets with someone in a hypo-manic state? Won’t agreeing with their accusations just make things worse?<strong style= "color: var(--color-text);"> **
**1. I am confused about the terms, negative and positive distortions.**
Dear Dr. Burns,
I do have one question about terms I have heard on the podcast. The terms that confuse me are "negative distortions" and "positive distortions." I think I understand that they are both "bad" distortions, but the  positive distortions are distortions related to moods or thoughts that are unhealthily high or "up," such as in mania or narcissism. And negative distortions are the ones related to lower mood states/depression. Is this correct? I don't know if it is a brain thing, but even though I think I understand the concepts, my brain still seems to automatically think of positive distortions as good, and so I become quite confused when trying to understand how to fight them or help someone else fight them . . .
Thank you again, so much, for all of your hard work on the podcast, as well as your diligence in training therapists in your TEAM model. I am a super-fan of the model already after only a week or so of listening! And the Five Secrets have challenged me to examine my communication abilities much more honestly and helped me in several important interactions already (even as a novice making many mistakes😬).
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Please also tell Fabrice and Rhonda many thanks for all of their hard work and excellence as well. They both bring such gifts and refreshing honesty, brilliance  and genuineness to the discussions. I especially admire Rhonda for sharing her personal work. Such powerful and transformative stuff! It gives me hope that someday I might be a fraction as brave to DO that kind of work, much less share it openly with others for their benefit. What a generous as well as brave thing to do! I feel so hopeful and encouraged to know there are therapists like you, Fabrice, and Rhonda helping people to heal from vast amounts of mental and emotional suffering. I can't wait for TEAM to be as commonly known everywhere as CBT is now. Sign me up to volunteer for any promotional efforts if that is ever needed! For now, I will continue to tell everyone, including quite a few other counselor friends, about the podcast and the TEAM model.
Sincerely,
A new super-fan podcast listener,

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Hi Holly, Many people are confused, so this is a great question! Rhonda and I will gladly discuss this on our podcast. And thanks for your kind words!

**2. Can you use the Five Secrets with someone in a hypo-manic state? Won’t agreeing with their accusations just make things worse?**

Hi David and Rhonda,

Thank you so much for the podcast. I have been an avid listener since the early days of the podcast, and it has helped me through very difficult times and still is.

My question is related to my relationship with my future to be divorcee. She is at times in a hypo mania state due to her bipolar illness (which is diagnosed and treated).

Is it possible to use the five secrets of effective communication with someone who is in a state of hypo mania? I feel that agreeing with unreasonable accusations and complains is not helping at all and only causes her to hold to these claims.

I know that you usually like to relate to specific correspondence but it is more of a general question.

I hope you can give me some guidelines on what works and what doesn’t.

Thanks!

Al
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Hi Al,
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The devil is in the details. Can you provide a specific example of one thing she said, and exactly what you said next, that you need some help with? General questions about the Five Secrets are NEVER productive. Great question, thanks! david
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">David D. Burns, M.D.

Hi Dr. Burns,

Thanks for the prompt reply.

Well, I was asking a general question if it is possible at all to use the 5 Secrets with someone who is totally unreasonable?

She would say "You started to be a father when you decided to divorce" referring to the fact that I am claiming for joint custody. The fact of the matter is that she has been going in and out of long depression periods and manic periods and I had to take care of the kids, maintain the house and keep a job (working from home).

I would answer that I was there taking care of the kids all the years and now that I decide to break I want to keep my fair share of the time with them.

Prior to that she always claimed that I am not a good spouse although I took care of her during all the years and had at times to reduce my workload in order to be available for the kids and her.

So, the claims and accusations are always discounting what I did for her and the kids. And she is not accepting the fact that she has been ill and that this had a toll on the family. She says I need to look forward even though these episodes on hypo mania keep repeating.

Hope I was specific enough. If you still feel I am vague then it may be that this is not the right forum to ask such questions and may need to get proper consultation.

All the best and looking forward to reading the new book. I already started with the free chapter.

Al

David and Rhonda describe 'mania" and "hypo-mania" model how to find truth in criticisms that seem irrational, exaggerated, untrue, or unfair. They also discuss the tendency to blame others for the problems in our relationships, and why and how that is rarely or never helpful.

**3. “How do you treat an “existential crisis?”**

Good afternoon Dr. Burns,

Have you treated anyone that went through an existential crisis before and were you successful? I have a wife that deals with depression and I was in the past able to help her (even though my mind set was "life is awesome. so why or how can you be upset?")

I have also dealt with my own anxiety and was able to get myself out of that 10 years ago, using exposure techniques. But I have ran into a bit of a wall here with what I believe is an existential crisis. I've noticed that I am unable to find anything of that subject in any of your topics.

Thank you for your time, Dr. Burns.

In the podcast, Rhonda and I demonstrate how to respond effectively to someone who is depressed, and why cheer-leading (“life is awesome,” etc.) will generally **not** be helpful.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Hi Arturo,
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">There are no existential crises in California at this time, as the Buddha pointed out more than 2500 years ago. However, specific and real problems exist, and once you identify what’s bugging you and you deal with it you’ll find your “existential crisis” has disappeared.
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Check out my podcast on [the teenage girl who was having an “identity crisis."](https://feelinggood.com/2016/11/06/podcast-6-ask-david-identity-crisis-finding-a-cbt-therapist-love-me-the-way-i-am/)
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Our podcast on “[How to Help](https://feelinggood.com/2019/10/28/164-how-to-help-and-how-not-to-help/)” might also be useful to you!
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You might also enjoy my book, **When Panic Attacks**, especially the section on the [Hidden Emotion Technique.](https://feelinggood.com/2016/05/28/hidden-emotion-technique/) If you go to my website, you can type any topic in the search box in the right-hand panel of every page, and a lot of useful information, will suddenly pop up.
