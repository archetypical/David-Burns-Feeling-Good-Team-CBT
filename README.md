# Feeling Awesome

A curated list of David Burns' contribution to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and beyond.

Right now it's just a rip of the RSS feed, which I've cleaned up into an orderly\naviable structure, and trimmed down the show notes. 

The initial idea is to make a high-level map of Dr. Burns' TEAM therapy.

There are a number of directions to go from there, like mapping out universal human fears and anxieties, cognitive distorties, negative thoughts, etc.

## Needs and Self Defeating Beliefs (SDB)

### [038: Ask David — Negative Messages from Society](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/038-ask-david-negative-messages-from-society)

A listener named Daisy describes her despair at being unable to have a baby, despite intensive efforts at a fertility clinic. She gets well-meaning messages from friends, family and support groups that she really **needs** a baby in order to feel truly happy and fulfilled, and these messages make her feel anxious and depressed. But she wonders whether this is really true. Does she **really** need a baby to feel happy?

In fact, we we get all kinds of messages from society that we need certain things in order to feel worthwhile, including:

* Achievement / Success / Wealth
* Intelligence
* Perfection
* Love
* Approval
* Popularity
* Good looks

Are these things really **needs**? Listen to today’s podcast and you may be surprised by the answer!

### [046: All You Need Is Love... or Do You?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/046-all-you-need-is-love-or-do-you)

[The Beatles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsxtImDVMig) tell us that all we need really need is love, and in her famous song, “People,” [Barbara Streisand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPlQ6EtArSc) proclaims that “People who need people are the luckiest people in the world.” But is this really true?

Fabrice asks David whether love is a human need? David describes hearing Dr. Aaron Beck proclaim that love is not an **adult** human need, and feeling shocked, during one of Dr. Beck’s cognitive therapy seminars in the 1970s. Although initially skeptical, David did a number of experiments to test this belief, and came to a startling conclusion. David describes the impact of needing love on his depressed and anxious patients, including lonely individuals who were constantly being rejected in the dating scene.

You’ll find this podcast provocative, controversial, and hopefully interesting. We’ll also include a survey you can complete below, indicating your thoughts about this topic!

In the next Feeling Good Podcast, David and Fabrice will discuss **Tools, Not Schools**, the title of David’s TEAM-CBT eBook for therapists, and the following podcast will discuss Relapse Prevention Training, since the likelihood of relapse after successful treatment is 100%. But if the patient is prepared and knows what to do ahead of time, the relapse, while often painful and disturbing, doesn’t have to be a significant problem.

### [118: Self-Defeating Beliefs (Part 1) — The Beliefs That Defeat You](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/118-self-defeating-beliefs-part-1-the-beliefs-that-defeat-you)

Rajesh asked:
* Is it possible to change an SDB?
* Does the mere knowledge of an SDB change it?
* How long does it take to change an SDB?
* How do you change SDBs?

Nikola asked:
* Aaron Beck said the SDBs never really go away. They just get activated and deactivated and activated again. Does this mean that depression is an incurable disease that will keep coming back over and over again?
* What’s the point in battling against a core belief if it cannot be changed?
Fabrice and I appreciate your questions--they often give us ideas for shows! In today’s Podcast you'll learn the answers to several questions about Self-Defeating Beliefs.

**What’s the difference between Self-Defeating Beliefs (SDBs) vs. Cognitive Distortions?**

The thoughts that contain cognitive distortions, such as All-or-Nothing Thinking, Overgeneralization, Discounting the Positive, and Self-Blame are distortions of reality, they are the cons that trigger depression and anxiety. When you're upset, these thoughts will flood your mind. These thoughts can be show to be false, and when you crush a distorted negative thought, you'll immediately feel better.

Self-Defeating Beliefs are stipulations, values that you've set up for your self. For example, you may base your self-esteem on your accomplishments due to your belief that people who accomplish more are more worthwhile as human beings. SDBs like this cannot actually be shown to be false--they are simply your personal, subjective values, and they are thought to be with you all the time, and not just when you're depressed, anxious, or angry.

The question with an SDB is this: What are the advantages and disadvantages of having this value system? How will it help me--what are the benefits--and how might it hurt me? What's the downside?

**Why are Self-Defeating Beliefs thought to be important?**

When you challenge and defeat a distorted thought, you feel better in the here-and-now. When you challenge and change an SDB, you change your value system at a deep level. This is thought to make you less vulnerable to painful mood swings and relationship conflicts in the future.

**What are the different kinds of SDBs?**
* [David’s list of 23 Common SDBs is attached](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Self-Defeating-Beliefs-list-v-1.pdf). This list is not comprehensive, as there are many more, but the ones on the list are very common. There are several categories of SDBs.
* Individual SDBs are often “Self-Esteem Equations” * Perfectionism
* Perceived Perfectionism
* Achievement Addiction
* Approval Addiction
* Love Addiction

* Interpersonal SDBs are expectations of what will happen in certain kinds of relationships, or relationships in general * What’s your understanding of the other person’s role in your relationship? What adjectives describe him or her?
* What’s your understanding of your person’s role in the relationship? What adjectives describe you?
* How would that kind of relationship feel?
* What rules connect the two roles?

* Other kinds of SDBs * Anger / conflict cluster * Entitlement
* Truth
* Blame

* Anxiety cluster * Niceness
* Conflict Phobia
* Anger Phobia
* Emotophobia
* Submissiveness
* Spotlight Fallacy
* Brushfire Fallacy


**How can you identify your own, or a patient’s, Self-Defeating Beliefs?**

* Look at the list of 23 individual [SDBs](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Self-Defeating-Beliefs-list-v-1.pdf) (easiest). You might want to do that right now. Review the list, and you'll probably find many of your own beliefs!

* Interpersonal Downward Arrow

### [119: Self-Defeating Beliefs (Part 2) — Can You Change Them?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/119-self-defeating-beliefs-part-2-can-you-change-them)

**How can you get rid of [Self-Defeating Beliefs](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Self-Defeating-Beliefs-list-v-1.pdf)?**

Although any of the 100 + TEAM-CBT methods can be used to modify an SDB, four methods will be highlighted in today's show.

* Cost-Benefit Analysis
* Semantic Method
* Experimental Technique
* Feared Fantasy

For more information on how to change SDBs, you might want to watch the extremely popular David and Jill  FB Live show on [Overcoming Perfectionism](https://www.facebook.com/DavidBurnsMD/videos/548965778908540/) (recorded on November 11, 2018).

**What research has been done on SDBs?**

This topic was not discussed in the show, but individuals with an interest in research might want to read David’s study with Dr. Jackie Persons on the causal connections between depression and SDBs about dependency (attachment) as well as achievement (perfectionism) in several hundred patients in Philadelphia during the first 12 weeks of their treatment at David’s clinic.

The study confirmed That both types of SBS were significantly correlated with depression severity at intake and at the 12-week evaluation. In addition, changes in depression were correlated with changes in SDBs. However, a sophisticated statistical analysis with structural equation modeling techniques did not confirm that SDBs had causal effects on depression, or that depression had causal effects on SDBs. Instead, SDBs and feelings of depression appeared to share an unknown common cause.

* Persons, J. B., Burns, D. D., Perloff, J. M., & Miranda, J. (1993). Relationships between symptoms of depression and anxiety and dysfunctional beliefs about achievement and attachment. **Journal of Abnormal Psychology**, 101(4): 518 - 524.

### [012: Negative and Positive Distortions (Part 3)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/012-negative-and-positive-distortions-part-3)

> Discuss of "**Should" Statements**, **Labeling**, and **Blame**. Dr. Burns brings these distortions to life with a case of a severely depressed woman who felt profoundly guilty and devastated after her brother’s tragic suicide.

### [037: Ask David — "My negative thoughts aren't distorted!"](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/037-ask-david-my-negative-thoughts-arent-distorted)

**“My problems are real! The world really IS screwed up! And that’s not a distortion. So what can I do about my severe depression and anxiety?”**

David and Fabrice discuss two questions submitted by Feeling Good Podcast listeners.

#1. Shari writes: 'how can we attend to our own emotional well-being in the face of genuine adversity?'

> Dr. Burns discusses this from the perspective of Paradoxical Agenda Setting, which is the key component of TEAM-CBT, and emphasizes the most common therapeutic error of all—jumping in to try to help, without seeing all the really GOOD reasons for the patient NOT to change. From this perspective, Shari’s question becomes the most important question in all of psychiatry and psychotherapy—how do we help patients who may not want to change?

#2. After listening to the A = Agenda Setting portion of the live therapy with Mark, Paul submitted this question:

“Hi David,

> I am wondering what your thoughts are on how effectively the "A" step can be carried out by a patient on his/her own (i.e. without someone else verbalizing the reasons not to change / playing the part of the patient's sub-conscious)? Do you have any tips? I think I heard Mark say something to the effect that, on his own, he wouldn't have thought of all the positives that you came up with in the session.

> This was another terrific question on a topic of great importance. David explains that it is actually easier for patients to learn to use Positive Reframing and the other Paradoxical Agenda Setting techniques than for therapists to learn them.

## [082: Neil Sattin Interview — Cognitive Distortions and Relationships](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/082-neil-sattin-interview-cognitive-distortions-and-relationships)

> This interview was first published on Neil Sattin's highly regarded [Relationship Alive Podcast](https://www.neilsattin.com/). Although some of the material may be familiar, there's much that's new, and you will enjoy the chemistry between Neil and David as they discuss each of the ten cognitive distortions and raise many challenging questions, such as:

> * Is it **really** true that only our thoughts--and NOT external events--can change the way we feel?
> * If someone has the belief, "I'm unlovable," isn't that type of thought immutable? How could you possibly change or modify a thought that may be rooted in traumatic experiences and so deeply embedded in a patient's psyche?
> * Should we try to change other people's cognitive distortions, or just our own?
> * How can we challenge each of the ten cognitive distortions?
And much more!

David's first interview with Neil received more than 25,000 downloads in the first month, and this riveting interview promises to be every bit as popular. If you want to download [a transcript of this exciting interview](https://www.neilsattin.com/blog/2018/03/133-change-thoughts-change-life-cognitive-distortions-dr-david-burns/), you can do so at www.neilsattin.com.

## Addiction

### [063: Ask David — What’s Good About Hopelessness or Addiction? What Is it to Be a Worthwhile Human Being?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/063-ask-david-whats-good-about-hopelessness-or-addiction-what-is-it-to-be-a-worthwhile-human-being)

Is there anything positive about hopelessness or an addiction ? What does it take to be a "worthwhile" human being, or to have a valuable life?

In today’s podcast, David and Fabrice address three questions submitted by listeners:

* Avi asks another great question about the importance of Positive Reframing in TEAM-CBT. But how can we possibly find something positive in the feeling of hopelessness. After all, Dr. Aaron Beck has taught us that it's the worst emotion of all!
* Avi asks a similar question about an addiction. How can an addiction possibly be a good thing?
* Eugene asks a tremendous question about a passage in Dr. Burns' book, **Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy**, on the topic of what it means to be a worthwhile human being, and what it takes to make a life valuable. Eugene hints that Dr. Burns may have the wrong idea, and asks what he would say to a patient who doesn't "cry uncle!"
David and Fabrice love your questions so keep them coming!

### [115: Healing Addiction with Stephen Pfleiderer](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/115-healing-addiction-with-stephen-pfleiderer)

Fabrice and I were thrilled to interview our dear friend and colleague, Stephen Pfleiderer, who is the first therapist in the world using TEAM-CBT techniques in the treatment of habits and addictions, including

* life threatening addictions, like intravenous heroin or meth
* marijuana
* alcohol
* binge eating
* procrastination
* smoking
* internet porn
* and more

Stephen begins with his personal story of excessive beer drinking starting in high school through his junior year in college when he hit a personal crisis, telling himself, "My life sucks. I can't live like this. I'm a loser." He decided to enter a 12-step recovery program, which helped tremendously, and eventually joined David's weekly TEAM training group at Stanford because of his dream of becoming a professional addiction therapist and interventionist.

### [117: Stephanie James Interview (Part 3) — The Trifecta of Feeling Terrific](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/117-stephanie-james-interview-part-3-the-trifecta-of-feeling-terrific)

I recently did two terrific interviews (Podcasts #92 and #111) with Stephanie James on her superb radio show and podcast, **<u>[The Spark](https://www.thesparkpod.com/episodes/)</u>**. Today, Fabrice and I are bringing you my third and final interview with Stephanie, as we describe how to convert conflicted relationships into loving, rewarding ones.

Stephanie said it was her favorite interview, although all three were really fun for me. Today you will once again hear how dynamic, warm and positive she is!

My first interview with Stephanie was on the amazing inner power we all have to change our thoughts, feelings, actions, and lives. We talked about how to transform your automatic negative thoughts and create a more joyful present and a more fulfilling future.

My second interview with Stephanie was on the evolution of traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) into the new TEAM-CBT. We highlighted the amazing new motivation-busting techniques that can lead to extraordinarily rapid recovery.

Stephanie also recently interviewed our beloved colleague, Dr. Matthew May, a psychiatrist who is a phenomenal TEAM therapist. [Click here if you'd like to take a look and listen](https://www.thesparkpod.com/episodes/029-breakthrough-to-healing-with-dr-matthew-may/.

Matt has worked with Fabrice and me on our podcasts--you may remember the amazing and inspiring podcasts featuring [live therapy with Marilyn.](https://feelinggood.com/2017/08/07/049-live-session-marilyn-testing-empathy-part-1/)

Stephanie is a outstanding therapist and radio personality from Colorado. It was an honor to be on her show on three occasions. Stephanie is co-authoring a book on how to live a “spark-filled life.” It should be completed soon, so you’ll likely be hearing much more from Stephanie during 2019!

## OCD and TEAM CBT

### [021: Ask David — Shameful Sexual Fantasies](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/021-ask-david-shameful-sexual-fantasies)

A listener with OCD is plagued with intrusive and shameful sexual fantasies. David discusses his treatment strategies for a young man from Argentina who was struggling with forbidden fantasies of Jesus having sex with the Virgin Mary in all positions of the Kama Sutra, but the harder he tried to control them, the more intense and tantalizing they became. Being a good Catholic lad, he was terrified and tearful he would burn in hell if he didn’t overcome this problem.

If you’ve ever struggled with shameful sexual fantasies, you might be intrigued by this fascinating discussion of **Cognitive Flooding**, therapeutic resistance, and the **Hidden Emotion Technique**!

### [043: Ask David — The Hidden Emotion Technique for OCD](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/043-ask-david-the-hidden-emotion-technique-for-ocd)

Mon, 03 Jul 2017 05:00:00 +0000

Listeners submitted questions on OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder): 
* Is it an organic illness? 
* Are drugs necessary in the treatment? 
* What’s the best book to read if you want to heal yourself? 
* What’s the prognosis?
Drs. Nye and Burns begin by explaining OCD and answering the questions. 

> David emphasizes the importance of using four treatment models when working with OCD—the cognitive model, the motivational model, the exposure model, and the hidden emotion model if you are hoping for a rapid and complete elimination of symptoms. Treatment that focus on only one treatment method, such as exposure and response prevention, may have only limited success.

> Although years of conventional psychotherapy had failed this patient, the [**Hidden Emotion Technique**](https://feelinggood.com/2016/05/28/hidden-emotion-technique/) led to an incredible recovery in just a few minutes during a therapy session. You will find this true story inspiring and amazing! And David provides an even more amazing 40-year follow up report!

#027: [**Scared Stiff — The Hidden Emotion Model**](https://feelinggood.com/2017/03/13/027-scared-stiff-the-hidden-emotion-model-part-5/).

### [044: Can OCD Be Cured?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/044-can-ocd-be-cured)

Mon, 10 Jul 2017 05:00:00 +0000

> David describes his treatment of a physician with OCD who was tortured by the fear that he would impulsively throw his newborn baby over the railing of his second-floor apartment. He also describes a psychologist with OCD who washed her hands more than 50 times a day for fear of contamination. In addition, she spent hours every day making sure that nothing in her house was arranged in groups of three—including furniture, table settings, decorative objects, magazines on tables, and so forth.

> What were the hidden emotions that fueled these obsessions and compulsions? David and Fabrice will give you the chance to pause the recording on three occasions to jot down your hypotheses before they give you the answers. It won't be important to get it "right," but it is highly desirable to take a stab at it.

> This podcast will be of interest to you if you or a loved one is struggling with OCD, or **any** form of anxiety, including phobias, panic attacks, chronic worrying, and so forth. That's because the hidden emotion phenomenon, or excessive “niceness,” may be a the root of your fears as well. Bringing those feelings to conscious awareness will often lead to sudden relief, or even a complete elimination of your symptoms.

### [045: More on OCD — Cognitive Flooding](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/045-more-on-ocd-cognitive-flooding)

Mon, 17 Jul 2017 05:00:00 +0000

> Then David describes his treatment of a pregnant woman with OCD who was afraid her baby would be switched at the hospital so that she’d end up with the wrong baby. Although she rationally recognized that this fear was irrational, she could not shake it from her mind, and obsessed about it constantly.

> After trying more than 30 CBT techniques that did not work, David used the What-If Technique to pinpoint her deepest fear, which turned out to be quite shocking, to say the least. He then encouraged her, with some reluctance, to confront this fear using Cognitive Flooding.

> After describing the surprising outcome, David and Fabrice discuss the fact that 75% of American therapists are afraid to use Exposure Techniques because of the fear that the patient is too fragile, or they will re-traumatize the patient. David reminds us that this is “reverse hypnosis,” where the patient hypnotizes the therapist into believing something that is not true. If the patient is successful, and the therapist agrees not to use Exposure, the prognosis for effective treatment is quite poor.

### “Yikes! I might get contaminated!” ### The Treatment of Sara Today we are joined by a woman named Sara, who will be featured in one of the chapters from my new book, **Feeling Great**.

> You are probably aware that OCD plagued the life of the billionaire playboy, Howard Hughes, featured in the recent film, “The Aviator.” During the last years of his life, he became totally consumed by concerns about germs, and ended up isolated in the penthouse suite at the top of a hotel in Las Vegas. According to a [“psychological autopsy”](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes) published by the American Psychological Association, Hughes lay naked in bed in darkened hotel rooms in what he considered a germ-free zone. He even wore tissue boxes on his feet to protect them, and burned his clothing if someone near him became ill.

> Sara, today’s guest, was a victim of the same type of OCD. She describes how her intense fears of germs and contamination came on more than 20 years ago, and the devastating impact of the OCD on her as well as her relationships with friends and family. She also describes her shame about her rituals of constantly washing her hands and desperately trying to avoid contamination.
