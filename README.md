# David Burns | Feeling Good | TEAM-CBT

A curated list of David Burns' contribution to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and beyond.

At the moment, in each of these files are links to Feeling Good podcast episodes organized by topic.

Simply listening has been transformative, already. I am so grateful for Dr. Burns' work, have a few of his books on order. I see a world-changing potential in these techniques, along with [Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication](https://gitlab.com/prosocial-dynamic/nvc-rosenberg).

The initial idea of this project is to make a high-level map of Dr. Burns' TEAM therapy. 

I'd also like to make an index of related research and history, including the works of [Albert Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis), and [Aaron T Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_T._Beck).

There are a number of directions to go from there, like working on a set of universal human fears and anxieties, cognitive distorties, negative thoughts, etc.
