# David Burns | Feeling Good | TEAM-CBT

A curated list of David Burns' contribution to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and beyond.

At the moment, in each of these files are links to Feeling Good podcast episodes organized by topic.

The initial idea is to make a high-level map of Dr. Burns' TEAM therapy.

There are a number of directions to go from there, like figuring out a set of universal human fears and anxieties, cognitive distorties, negative thoughts, etc. 

Maybe tag all episodes w each distortion, method, and component of team.
