# David Burns' Feeling Good and TEAM-CBT Curated

##### A curated list of David Burns' contribution to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and beyond.

Simply listening has been transformative, already. I am so grateful for Dr. Burns' work, have a few of his books on order. I see a world-changing potential in these techniques.

The initial idea of this project is to make a high-level map of Dr. Burns' TEAM therapy. 
At the moment, a bulk of this project is simply a listing of [Feeling Good podcast episodes organized by topic](#feeling-good-podcast-directory). 

I'd also like to make an index of related research and history, including the works of [Albert Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis), and [Aaron T Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_T._Beck).

There are a number of directions to go from there, like working on a set of universal human fears and anxieties, cognitive distorties, negative thoughts, etc. I'd like to explore the connections between TEAM-CBT and mindfulness meditation ([Vipassana](https://dhamma.org)), along with [Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication](https://gitlab.com/prosocial-dynamic/nvc-rosenberg).

### Tools Not Schools of Psychotherapy

* [What’s the Best School of Psychotherapy?](https://feelinggood.com/2017/03/08/4069/)
  > All of the therapies appeared to be more effective than no therapy at all, and nearly all of the studies reported fairly significant gains for depressed patients, with one or another brand of therapy being identified as “the best.” But what was confusing was that each study seemed to identify a different brand of psychotherapy as the winner. Some researchers reported that cognitive therapy was the most effective treatment, while other researchers that psychodynamic therapy, behavior therapy worked the best, and so forth.
  > 
  > Then the researchers identified the school of therapy that the researchers felt allegiance to, and controlled for this potential source of bias in the statistical analyses. Now the results looked radically different—there were no differences at all between the different types of psychotherapy. They all performed about the same, and none performed in a really stellar way.
  > 
  > The researchers concluded that the outcome literature is heavily biased by the researchers who conduct the research, and proposed that we might be better off studying how psychotherapy works rather than trying to investigate which brand is the most effective, so that a new science of psychotherapy can evolve and replace the schools of therapy that currently compete with each other.

* [TEAM vs CBT](https://feelinggood.com/team-vs-cbt/)
  > I am very proud to have contributed to the birth and evolution of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which was one of the most important developments of 20th century psychiatry and psychology. When I first wrote my first book, Feeling Good, CBT was practically unknown. Now it has become one of the most widely practiced and researched forms of psychotherapy throughout the world. Aaron Beck, MD, Albert Ellis, PhD, and a host of other brilliant pioneers helped to create CBT, and we owe all of them an enormous debt of gratitude.

## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy \ Aaron Beck

* [What is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)?](https://beckinstitute.org/get-informed/what-is-cognitive-therapy/) - Beck Institute
  > Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapy that has been shown to be effective in over 2,000 research studies. It is a time-sensitive, structured, present-oriented psychotherapy that helps individuals identify goals that are most important to them and overcome obstacles that get in the way. CBT helps people get better and stay better.

  > From my research work, I was getting the idea that patients— depressed patients—had a negative representation of the self, as indicated in the dreams. Then I saw that they were having cognitive distortions. I got the notion that people had negative beliefs, and the negative beliefs would act as a kind of prism and would block out positive things and only allow in negative things. It was also a warped prism, so the interpretations that people would make of what was going on were distorted. 
  > 
  > Now we have the representations and we have the distortions, and then the question is, “What do you do about it?” At that particular time, I became aware of the work of Albert Ellis. Ellis had actually come before me in terms of seeing a relationship between people’s thinking and their affect, or their thinking and their behavior. He had already written a book on this, and he had developed a therapy that he called rational emotive therapy. 
  > 
  > I borrowed some of his thoughts—some of Ellis’s techniques—and I had people now start to examine their thinking, not challenge it, which was Ellis’s term, but to start to explore, investigate, evaluate their automatic thoughts. We would do this in a variety of ways. One is: If a person had a negative thought such as, “My wife doesn’t love me because she ran off without saying goodbye,” we’d say, “First of all, is this the only time she’s done this, or does she do this a lot? That’s selective abstraction. Are you making some general statement? This is overgeneralization,” and so on. Then we’d say, “Now, is there some alternative explanation? Does it logically follow that the reason she went off is because she didn’t care for you?”—a whole variety of techniques. 
  > 
  > What happened, and this was my next surprise, was when I started to have people look at their automatic thoughts, they started to get better. While I could have patients doing analytic therapy with me for two or three years, after about 10 or 12 sessions the patient would say, “Well, doctor, you’ve helped me a lot. Bye-bye.” My caseload shrunk, and pretty soon I was down to very few patients.

[Cognitive Therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0198) - Judith S. Beck
> The theory of CT was influenced by Greek Stoic philosophers and by a number of contemporary theorists such as Adler, Alexander, Horney, Sullivan, Kelly, Arnold, Ellis, Lazarus, Bandura, Lewinsohn, and Meichenbaum. Breaking with psychoanalytic models of theory and practice, Beck incorporated behavioral approaches as espoused by social learning, stress inoculation training, problem solving training, and self‐control therapy, with a primary emphasis on changing cognition as well as behavior.

## Albert Ellis

* [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis#Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy_(REBT))
  > From the late 1940s onwards, Ellis worked on rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), and by January 1953 his break with psychoanalysis was complete, and he began calling himself a rational therapist. Ellis was now advocating a new more active and directive type of psychotherapy. In 1955, he presented rational therapy (RT). In RT, the therapist sought to help the client understand—and act on the understanding—that his personal philosophy contained beliefs that contributed to his own emotional pain. This new approach stressed actively working to change a client's self-defeating beliefs and behaviours by demonstrating their irrationality, self-defeatism and rigidity. Ellis believed that through rational analysis and cognitive reconstruction, people could understand their self-defeatingness in light of their core irrational beliefs and then develop more rational constructs.
  > 
  > In 1954, Ellis began teaching his new techniques to other therapists, and by 1957, he formally set forth the first cognitive behavioral therapy by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as the treatment for emotional and behavioral problems. Two years later, Ellis published How to Live with a Neurotic, which elaborated on his new method.

* [An Introduction to the ABCs of REBT (Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy)](https://www.smartrecovery.org/smart-recovery-toolbox/abc-crash-course/)
  > A. (Activating situation) I tried to do something and failed
  > B. (Irrational Belief I have about A) I must always be successful
  > C. (Consequences of believing B) I feel bad, depressed, etc
  > D. (Dispute the Irrational Belief in B) where is it written in stone that I must I always be successful?
  > E. (Effective new thinking to replace B) I would prefer always to be successful but let’s be realistic- that isn’t very likely, is it- so when I’m not successful I don’t need to make myself feel bad.
