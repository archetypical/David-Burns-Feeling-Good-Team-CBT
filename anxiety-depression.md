### [013: Ask David — Is Anxiety Inevitable?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/013-ask-david-is-anxiety-inevitable)

A fan points out that many of the examples in David’s book, **When Panic Attacks**, are high functioning individuals with lots of education and good jobs. She asks Dr. Burns if depression and anxiety are inevitable among people who are poorly educated and without many assets. Dr. Burns again addresses the ancient but persistent question of whether our suffering results from the actual problems in our lives, or rather by our distorted thoughts about them.

### [016: Ask David — How can I cope with a complainer? How can I help a loved one who is depressed?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/016-ask-david-how-can-i-cope-with-a-complainer-how-can-i-help-a-loved-one-who-is-depressed)

How can you help a depressed friend or family member? You may be surprised to discover that the attempt to “help” is rarely effective, and may even **make the problem worse**. In contrast, the refusal to help is nearly always helpful. But to understand that paradox, you’ll have to give a listen to this fascinating edition of "Ask David!"

David and Fabrice also address a related problem nearly all of us confront from time to time: How do you deal with a friend who is a relentless whiner and complainer? When you try to help them or suggest a solution to the problem, they just say, “That won’t work” and keep complaining. You end up feeling frustrated and annoyed, because the other person just won’t listen! David and Fabrice illustrate a shockingly easy and incredibly effective solution to this problem.

Finally, David discusses some disturbing recent research indicating that the ability of therapists—as well as friends or family members—to know how suicidal someone is, is extremely poor. David and Fabrice explain how to assess how suicidal someone actually is, and what to do if you discover that he or she really is at risk of a suicide attempt.


### [016a: Special Interview: Can Depression and Anxiety Be Treated in a Two-Hour Therapy Session? with Lisa Kelley](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/016a-special-interview-can-depression-and-anxiety-be-treated-in-a-two-hour-therapy-session-with-lisa-kelley)	

David and Fabrice are joined by Lisa Kelley, a certified TEAM-CBT therapist and former journalist from Littleton, Colorado. 

Lisa begins by asking how people responded to a survey on David’s website asking this controversial question: 

“**Do you believe that a depressed individual could experience a complete elimination of symptoms in a single, two-hour therapy session?**” 

> More than 5,000 individuals completed the survey and most were extremely skeptical. David states that ten years ago, he would have felt exactly the same way, and would have dismissed anyone making such a claim as a con artist. However, he has now changed his mind and believes that sometimes it is possible. David explains that he has done more than 50 live demonstrations in workshops and other teaching settings with individuals who are struggling with severe feelings of depression, anxiety, shame and anger. Many of these individuals who volunteer to be the patient have experienced horrific personal traumas. This gives David the opportunity to demonstrate how TEAM-CBT works with someone who is really suffering, and not just a role-playing demonstration. 

> Usually, these live demonstrations are the highlight of a workshop because they are intensely emotional and real. Surprisingly, in the vast majority of these sessions, the individuals who were in the patient role experienced a complete, or near-complete, elimination of symptoms in roughly two hours.

### [020: The Truth About Antidepressants?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/020-the-truth-about-antidepressants)

Discussion of recent startling and disturbing research studies by Dr. Irving Kirsch and others that suggest that the chemicals called “antidepressants” may, in reality, have few or no true antidepressant effects above and beyond their placebo effects. Dr. Burns illustrates the placebo effect with a thought experiment, and explains why it is so confusing to researchers and the general public alike.

In addition, David and Fabrice discuss additional troubling research by Dr. David Healey and others that indicates that the chemicals called “antidepressants” appear to cause a doubling or tripling of the likelihood that a depressed individual will commit suicide or become actively suicidal, as compared with depressed individuals treated with placebos. David concludes with a discussion emphasizing that the needs of marketing are in conflict with the needs of sciences, and proposes some solutions to this serious problem.

Dr. Burns emphasizes that he is only providing his interpretation of some extremely controversial studies, based on his research training and clinical experience. He urges listeners to do their own research and critical thinking on this disturbing topic, and emphasizes that many may come to different conclusions.

## [022: Scared Stiff — What Is Anxiety? (Part 1)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/022-scared-stiff-what-is-anxiety-part-1)

David and Fabrice answer these questions:

* What is anxiety?
* How does it differ from depression?
* Do anxiety and depression always go hand in hand?
* How does anxiety differ from healthy fear?
* What are the most common forms of anxiety?
* How common is anxiety?

> Anxiety, like depression, has been called the world’s oldest con. That’s because you are always fooling yourself, and buying into negative thoughts that aren’t true, when you’re feeling anxious and insecure. Dr. Burns highlights the most common cognitive distortions that trigger anxiety, and discusses the powerful role of shame in anxiety.

## [023: Scared Stiff — What Causes Anxiety? What’s the Cure? (Part 2)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/023-scared-stiff-what-causes-anxiety-whats-the-cure-part-2)

There are 4 powerful treatment models for anxiety, including

* The Cognitive Model
* The Exposure Model
* The Motivational Model
* The Hidden Emotion Model

> Each approach has a completely different theory about the causes of anxiety and utilizes completely different treatment techniques. For example, cognitive therapists believe that distorted thoughts trigger all anxiety, and that the most effective treatment involves challenging these distortions. In contrast, exposure therapists argue that avoidance is the cause of all anxiety, and that exposure is the only effective treatment. Those who adhere to the Motivational Model emphasize the role of resistance. In other words, anxious individuals are reluctant to let go of the anxiety because they secretly believe that the anxiety will protect them from danger.  And those who adhere to the Hidden Emotion Model claim that “niceness” is the true cause of all anxiety in the United States at this time, and that hidden problems and feelings may need to be brought to conscious awareness before the patient can recover.
> 
> Dr. Burns argues that, in fact, all four theories are correct, and that if you skillfully integrate all four approaches, you will often see a rapid and total elimination of anxiety in the great majority of your patients.

## [024: Scared Stiff — The Cognitive Model (Part 3)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/024-scared-stiff-the-cognitive-model-part-3)

The cognitive model of anxiety is based on three powerful ideas:

* Anxiety always results from negative thought (NTs) that involve the prediction of danger. 
* The NTs that trigger anxiety are always distorted and illogical. In contrast, valid NTs cause healthy fear.
* When you put the lie to the distorted NTs, the anxiety will disappear.

## [026: Scared Stiff — The Exposure Model (Part 4)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/026-scared-stiff-the-exposure-model-part-4)

> We begin by describing the three different deaths of the ego that are required for recovery from depression, anxiety, or a relationship conflict, respectively. For depression recovery often results from the “Great Death,” A Buddhist concept that involves the discovery that there is no such thing as a “self” that could be worthless, or inferior, or judged by another person. David and Fabrice only touch on this theme and promise an entire future podcast on this fascinating and helpful spiritual notion that can lead to recovery from depression.

> For anxiety, the death of the ego is quite different, and involves surrendering to the monster the patient has always feared and avoided using a wide variety of exposure techniques. David traces the origin of Exposure Therapy to teachings in the Buddhist scriptures, the **Tibetan Book of the Dead**, more than 2,000 years ago. David describes the amazing and hilarious phenomenon of “laughing enlightenment,” which often happens when anxious individuals confront their fears.

> David and Fabrice end by talking about the enormous amount of information they have to share with listeners, including large numbers of creative exposure techniques that fall into three categories:
>  * Classical Exposure
>  * Cognitive Exposure
>  * Interpersonal Exposure


## [027: Scared Stiff — The Hidden Emotion Model (Part 5)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/027-scared-stiff-the-hidden-emotion-model-part-5)

Mon, 13 Mar 2017 05:00:00 +0000

> David explains that the Hidden Emotion Model is radically different from CBT, exposure therapy, and most other current treatments for anxiety. The theory behind Hidden Emotion Technique is that “niceness” is the cause of (almost) all anxiety in the United States at this time. In other words, people who are prone to anxiety typically think they have to be nice all the time, and please other people, and not have certain kinds of forbidden feelings, such as anger, or loneliness, or even wanting something you are not supposed to want.

> * The hidden emotion or conflict is buried in the present, and not in the past.
> * It is something very ordinary, such as not liking your job, or your major in college, or a conflict with a friend, family member or colleague.
> * The anxiety is nearly always a symbolic expression of the feeling or problem the patient is not bringing to conscious awareness. David gives listeners an exercise to see if they can pinpoint the symbolic meaning of Terry’s panic attacks.

##### He emphasizes the three things he really likes about the Hidden Emotion Model:

* It explains the timing of anxiety attacks, so it has tremendous explanatory power. Freud said that anxiety is the mysterious emotion, that comes out of the blue, and strikes like lightning, without rhyme or reason. David disagrees, and emphasizes that anxiety rarely or **never** comes from out of the blue.
* The Hidden Emotion Model can have powerful and rapid healing effects for patients with every type of anxiety, as well as individuals struggling with hypochondriasis and those who go to medical doctors with complaints of pain, fatigue, or dizziness that does not appear to have a valid medical cause.
* The Hidden Emotion Model teaches us that the ultimate cause of most anxiety is the fear of the self, of our emotions and how we genuinely feel as human beings.
* The Hidden Emotion Model teaches us that recovery from anxiety does not involve recovery from some “defect” or “mental disorder,” but rather the discovery of what it is like to be human being, with all of our feelings, and that it is okay to have an express those feelings.

> Finally, David explains that while this technique traces to the teachings of Freud, Freud might turn over in his grave and find it superficial or silly, since David simply tells anxious patients that they are suppressing or repressing something that’s bothering them, and insists they bring it to conscious awareness right away. 

> However, the “niceness” phenomenon only seems to affect about 75% of anxious patients; sometimes, a phobia is just a phobia, with no hidden feeling or conflict. Those individuals will not be helped by this technique. Fortunately, we have dozens of other powerful techniques that **will** be curative!

## [028: Scared Stiff — The Motivational Model (Part 6)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/028-scared-stiff-the-motivational-model-part-6)

> The key is bringing the patient’s subconscious resistance to conscious awareness, and melting it away with paradoxical techniques. This is absolutely critical if you are hoping to see a complete elimination of symptoms in any type of anxiety.

> You may recall that the Outcome Resistance for anxiety disorders usually results Magical Thinking—the anxious patient may be suffering intensely and asking for help, but secretly believes that something terrible will happen if the treatment is successful and the anxiety disappears. In other words, most anxious individuals are convinced that the anxiety is protecting him or her from some catastrophic event.

### [064: Ask David — Quick Cure for Excessive Worrying!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/064-ask-david-quick-cure-for-excessive-worrying)

**How would you treat excessive worrying?** a listener asks.

> David describes a new patient who had struggled with 53 years of failed therapy for excessive, relentless worrying, and describes how she was "totally and irreversibly cured" in just two therapy sessions, which was the "good news." The Hidden Emotion Technique was the key to her remarkably rapid recovery. David explains that the "even better news" was that her relentless worrying would come back over and over in the future, and that this was actually a really good thing!

> David also emphasizes the importance of using all the four models, along with a Daily Mood Log, when treating any form of anxiety: **the Motivational Model, the Cognitive Model, the Exposure Model, and the Hidden Emotion Model**. To learn more about how these four powerful treatment models work, you can listen to Podcasts 022 through #028.

The DSM5 is the **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders**, published by the American Psychiatric Association. It is used to assign diagnoses to patients. David critiques the DSM5  diagnostic criteria for "Generalized Anxiety Disorder" (GAD) and emphasizes that while worrying exists, and can easily be treated in most cases, the "mental disorder" called Generalized Anxiety Disorder does not exist, and is simply a fantasy made up by the psychiatrists who have created the DSM.

### [128: Intense Social Anxiety — What Can I Do?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/128-intense-social-anxiety-what-can-i-do)

#### You CAN Defeat Shyness!

> Lately, I've gotten lots of emails from podcast fans who struggle with shyness, which is categorized in DSM5 (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as "Social Anxiety Disorder." This is one of my favorite things to treat, since I struggled with practically EVERY type of social anxiety early in my life, so I really know how it feels and how to defeat it. It's incredibly common. In fact, when I give workshops for mental health professionals, I sometimes ask how many of them have struggled with shyness or public speaking anxiety, and nearly all the hands go up.

##### Here the are several different "flavors" of social anxiety recognized by the American Psychiatric Association, including:

Mon, 18 Feb 2019 09:00:00 +0000

* Shyness
* Public Speaking Anxiety
* Performance Anxiety (such as intense anxiety during a musical or athletic performance)
* Shy Bladder (or Bowel) Syndrome. This is the fear of peeing or pooing in a public restroom, for fear you'll freeze up or make too much noise and others will notice.
* Test Anxiety

> One common theme is the fear that others will notice your anxiety or poor performance and judge you. Another common source of suffering is shame of feeling like you are inherently flawed and will be seen as defective or even as insane by others. Sometimes, these fears become so extreme that they can significantly interfere with relationships and leisure-time activities as well as work.

> Five powerful Interpersonal Exposure Techniques that Dan might want to do under the supervision of his therapist, including:
> * The Survey Technique
> * Self-Disclosure
> * The Experimental Technique
> * Shame Attacking Exercises
> * The Feared Fantasy Technique

> David and Fabrice also discuss how to address patient and therapist fears of using powerful exposure techniques, and how the avoidance of exposure can sabotage the treatment. They describe four techniques David as developed to help therapists with this, including:
> * Dangling the Carrot
> * The Gentle Ultimatum
> * Sitting with Open Hands
> * Fallback Position

> David describes "Reverse Hypnosis." This is where the patient hypnotizes the therapist into giving up on exposure thinking that it is "too dangerous," or that the patient isn't "ready" or is "too fragile."

### [134: Smashing Shyness (Part 1) — Beating Social Anxiety](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/134-smashing-shyness-part-1-beating-social-anxiety)

Mon, 01 Apr 2019 08:00:00 +0000

#### **How to Overcome Shyness** David and Rhonda begin with two emails (among many) from listeners asking for more help on the problem of social anxiety.

> How do you distinguish a personality disorder - say, for example, Avoidant Personality Disorder, from "just" (and I don't mean that in a derogatory way) being depressed and anxious?

> I have never had a friend in any usual sense of the term, and I literally never spend time with anyone in my spare time except for my parents. As a consequence, I have never learned or understood how to make friends, and I have never been in an intimate relationship, or taken part in any of the social activities that are normal to other people (parties, school dances, etc.) The simplest things are rocket science to me. So, I’m interested to know when a person crosses over from “simply” being depressed or anxious into having a personality disorder.

> David explains that there is no such thing as “Avoidant Personality Disorder.” It is just an imaginary concept created by the American Psychiatric Association, and is applied to individuals with shyness that is so severe that it causes significant problems in their lives.

> They also read an email from “<u>[Abdul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul)</u>,” a podcast fan who’s been struggling with shyness.

> I’m from Pakistan. Please make podcasts on shyness and public speaking and other anxiety issues.
> 
> I have anxiety shyness. My father has also anxiety. I know he is not happy. I also sometime feel exactly like him.
> 
> And one of my cousins is very much depressed. He is a cleaner in a garments shop. He always use to pack clothes all the time even if they are kept properly.

[Dr. Burns’ Shyness Scale*](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Shyness-Scale-v-1.pdf). 
  > Instructions: Put a check to indicate how much you experience each symptom when you’re around other people. 

> We always start with a Daily Mood Log, focusing on how you were thinking and feeling at a specific moment when you felt shy. We don’t just throw techniques at patients based on a problem (shyness) or diagnosis (Social Anxiety Disorder). We're all different, so the treatment is highly individualized. 

> David and Rhonda talk about reducing the Outcome and Process Resistance before trying to “help” Jason, or any one who's anxious. Outcome Resistance means that Jason may have some pretty strong resistance to recovery, in spite of how much he's suffered, even if all he had to do was to press a Magic Button and be instantly cured.

> Process Resistance, in contrast, means that if Jason **does** want to recover, he’ll have to use some Interpersonal Exposure Techniques that will be frightening to him. Is he willing to do that if David agrees to treat his shyness?

> David and Rhonda illustrate how to do Positive Reframing , listing all the really positive things about Jason's negative thoughts and feelings.  They encourage listeners to turn off the podcast briefly, and see if they can list some positives before listening to the list that David and Rhonda generated. I'd encourage you to do that, too, while listening. 

> They discuss how they might issue a Gentle Ultimatum, along with Dangling the Carrot and “Sitting with Open Hands,” to reduce Jason’s Process Resistance. 

> Once Jason's resistance has been reduced, they will go on to the M = Methods of the session, and focus on how to help Jason challenge the Negative Thoughts that Jason had while standing in line waiting to check his groceries.

### [135: Smashing Shyness (Part 2) — Beating Social Anxiety](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/135-smashing-shyness-part-2-beating-social-anxiety)

Mon, 08 Apr 2019 08:00:00 +0000

> Jason, who we introduced in the last podcast, wanted to work on the intense anxiety he felt in the locate grocery store. He thought the woman checking groceries was attractive, but he was terrified about talking to her, or trying to flirt. So he said nothing, and left the store feeling like a failure. 
> 
> After this humiliating experience, he filled out a Daily Mood Log and listed all the Negative Thoughts and feelings he'd had while waiting to check his groceries. After doing Positive Reframing, he decided on the Negative Though he wanted to work on first: “People will think I’m a self-centered jerk if I try to flirt with her.” David and Jason put this thought in the Recovery Circle and selected more than 20 techniques Jason could use to challenge thought. 

> David and Rhonda illustrate how to challenge that thought using many of the methods listed on the Recovery Circle, including:

> * **Identify the Distortions.** They found all ten distortions in this thought.
> * **The Straightforward Technique.** This technique was not effective, since the Positive Thought Jason came up with was not valid, and it did not reduce his belief in the Negative Thought. However, this technique did reveal something important about Jason—he seems to see the world in an adversarial way, and imagines he is in competition with others who will try to put him down.
> * **The Cost-Benefit Analysis.** What the are Advantages and Disadvantages of Jason’s Negative Thought? Jason did a remarkable job with this technique, and found it helpful and illuminating.
> * **The Individual Downward Arrow Technique.** David and Rhonda illustrated how this works, using role-playing. 
> They were able to identify five of Jason’s Self-Defeating Beliefs that are extremely common in Social Anxiety, including: 
>   * Perfectionism
>   * Perceived Perfectionism
>   * The Approval Addiction
>   * The Spotlight Fallacy
>   * The Brushfire Fallacy
>   * **The Paradoxical Double Standard Technique.** What would Jason say to a dear friend who was also struggling with severe shyness? Would he say, “People will think you’re a self-centered jerk if you try to flirt with her.” 
> * **Examine the Evidence.**  What’s the evidence that people will think he’s a self-centered jerk if he tries to flirt with a young lady he’s attracted to?
> * **Survey Technique.** Have his friends ever struggled with anxiety when they were starting to date?
> * **Thinking in Shades of Gray.**  He’s telling himself that if she shoots him down, it will prove that he’s a “loser.” Are there other reasons why a grocery checker might not respond favorably to a young man who is trying to flirt with her?
> * **Feared Fantasy / Acceptance Paradox.**  David and Rhonda illustrate this amazing technique, with role-reversals. This technique will help Jason crush the Self-Defeating Beliefs that cause his shyness in the first place, like the Approval Addiction.
> * **Smile and Hello practice**
> * **Flirting Training**
> * **Talk show Host**
> * **Rejection Practice**
> * **Self-Disclosure**
> * **Shame Attacking Exercises**

Mon, 27 May 2019 08:00:00 +0000

> In this heart-warming and very human session, Rhonda shares [the negative thoughts and feelings she had](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rhonda-DML-v-2-revised.pdf) when she listened to herself on several podcasts and begin noticing this or that error she made. She felt intensely down, anxious, ashamed, inadequate, rejected, embarrassed, discouraged, frustrated, and angry, to name just a few of her negative feelings, and her mind was flooded with negative thoughts like these:

> * I sound stupid and inarticulate, and some of my comments were inaccurate, like when I said psychiatric diagnoses are meaningless labels.
> * I’ve had feelings of insecurity ever since I was a child, and should be over this by now!
> * David is going to regret having me as the podcast host!
> * Everyone will know I’m a fraud, and no one will like or respect me> .
> * People will judge and reject me, and I’ll end up ostracized and alone.

She believed these thoughts at 100%. You might recall that the Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for emotional distress are:
> * You have one or more negative thoughts.
> * You believe the negative thoughts.

In today’s podcast, you will hear the first half of the session, which included T = Testing as well as E = Empathy. 

### [143: Performance Anxiety: The Conclusion](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/143-performance-anxiety-the-conclusion)

Mon, 03 Jun 2019 08:00:00 +0000

### Session with Rhonda, Part 2

Last week we published the first half of the session with Rhonda, who was struggling with severe performance anxiety about her work as the new host of the Feeling Good Podcast host. We did the initial T = Testing, which indicated many intense negative feelings, as well as E = Empathy phase of TEAM therapy session.

This week, we include the conclusion of the session, with A = Paradoxical Agenda Setting and M = Methods, plus final T = Testing to see how effective, or ineffective the session was.

> David and Rhonda used many TEAM-CBT techniques they during the session, including these:
> * David Empathized with the Five Secrets of Effective Communication at the start of the session during the E = Empathy phase. Of course, good empathy is necessary throughout a therapy session.
> * David melted away Rhonda’s resistance during the A = Paradoxical Agenda Setting. These techniques included: 
>   * Straightforward Invitation
>   * Miracle Cure Question
>   * Magic Button
>   * Positive Reframing
>   * Pivot Question
>   * Magic Dial
> * The M = Methods that were helpful in this session included included: 
> * The Individual Downward Arrow to identify the Self-Defeating Beliefs that triggered Rhonda’s feelings of inadequacy.
> Rhonda enjoyed this exercise and felt it was on target. We identified many beliefs, including: 
>   * Perfectionism
>   * Perceived Perfectionism
>   * Achievement Addiction
>   * Approval Addiction
>   * Love Addiction
>   * Fear of Rejection
>   * Submissiveness
>   * Inadequacy schema
>   * Spotlight Fantasy
>   * Brushfire Fallacy
>   * Superwoman
> * The Interpersonal Downward Arrow to illuminate how Rhonda saw her relationship with her father, with David, and with some other people, including the podcast listeners. This is kind of like Psychoanalysis at warp speed. Rhonda said this felt uncomfortable, perhaps because it cast David somewhat as a dangerous ogre!
> * David and Rhonda smashed several of Rhonda’s Self-Defeating Beliefs with the Feared Fantasy Technique
> * Identify the Distortions
> * Paradoxical Double Standard Technique
> * Externalization of Voices
> * Acceptance Paradox / Self-Defense Paradigm
> * Self-Disclosure / Exposure
> * The Experimental Technique
> * Thinking in Shades of Gray


### [169: More on Social Anxiety-The Case for Vulnerability!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/169-more-on-social-anxiety-the-case-for-vulnerability-0)

Today's podcast features Michael Simpson, a friend and colleague of Dr Burns, who describes his personal battle with social anxiety. Dave Fribush will again be our host, since Rhonda is celebrating the important religious holiday of Yom Kippur with her family.

Michael first became acquainted with David when he read David’s book, [**When Panic Attacks**](https://amzn.to/2H91zYI), which he says was SO GOOD! But when he went to David’s website, [www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com), he was shocked to see so much terrific free content for people, but the website was not well-presented. In fact, it was pretty sucky!

So, Michael sent David a brief video, pointing out all the problems, and offered to redo the website in exchange for some help with his social anxiety—and the relationship took off from there!

Michael describes his own experiences with social anxiety, which amounts to slight to moderate nervousness, tension and dis-ease during interactions with people. There is no apparent pattern to his triggers: he can become anxious (or not) around friends, strangers, men, women he is attracted to, and women he is not attracted to. He experiences the anxiety physically: butterflies in his stomach, tension around his face and a general tightness in his body. He is usually unaware of his negative thoughts, which involve fears of looking weak, being judged by others because of his anxiety, and being unable to connect with others while he is feeling anxious. He usually tries to hide all of these fears.

If you are struggling with social anxiety, you might also enjoy my book, **Intimate Connections**. It's now a bit dated, but the ideas can still be tremendously helpful.
