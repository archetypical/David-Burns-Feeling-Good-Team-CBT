### [037: Ask David — "My negative thoughts aren't distorted!"](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/037-ask-david-my-negative-thoughts-arent-distorted)

**“My problems are real! The world really IS screwed up! And that’s not a distortion. So what can I do about my severe depression and anxiety?”**

David and Fabrice discuss two questions submitted by Feeling Good Podcast listeners.

#1. Shari writes: 'how can we attend to our own emotional well-being in the face of genuine adversity?'

> Dr. Burns discusses this from the perspective of Paradoxical Agenda Setting, which is the key component of TEAM-CBT, and emphasizes the most common therapeutic error of all—jumping in to try to help, without seeing all the really GOOD reasons for the patient NOT to change. From this perspective, Shari’s question becomes the most important question in all of psychiatry and psychotherapy—how do we help patients who may not want to change?

#2. After listening to the A = Agenda Setting portion of the live therapy with Mark, Paul submitted this question:

“Hi David,

> I am wondering what your thoughts are on how effectively the "A" step can be carried out by a patient on his/her own (i.e. without someone else verbalizing the reasons not to change / playing the part of the patient's sub-conscious)? Do you have any tips? I think I heard Mark say something to the effect that, on his own, he wouldn't have thought of all the positives that you came up with in the session.

> This was another terrific question on a topic of great importance. David explains that it is actually easier for patients to learn to use Positive Reframing and the other Paradoxical Agenda Setting techniques than for therapists to learn them.

## [082: Neil Sattin Interview — Cognitive Distortions and Relationships](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/082-neil-sattin-interview-cognitive-distortions-and-relationships)

> This interview was first published on Neil Sattin's highly regarded [Relationship Alive Podcast](https://www.neilsattin.com/). Although some of the material may be familiar, there's much that's new, and you will enjoy the chemistry between Neil and David as they discuss each of the ten cognitive distortions and raise many challenging questions, such as:

> * Is it **really** true that only our thoughts--and NOT external events--can change the way we feel?
> * If someone has the belief, "I'm unlovable," isn't that type of thought immutable? How could you possibly change or modify a thought that may be rooted in traumatic experiences and so deeply embedded in a patient's psyche?
> * Should we try to change other people's cognitive distortions, or just our own?
> * How can we challenge each of the ten cognitive distortions?
And much more!

David's first interview with Neil received more than 25,000 downloads in the first month, and this riveting interview promises to be every bit as popular. If you want to download [a transcript of this exciting interview](https://www.neilsattin.com/blog/2018/03/133-change-thoughts-change-life-cognitive-distortions-dr-david-burns/), you can do so at www.neilsattin.com.
