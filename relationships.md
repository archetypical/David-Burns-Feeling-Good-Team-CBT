First in a series of podcasts on how to transform troubled relationships into loving ones—if that's what you want to do!

> David begins with the story of how he got into working with troubled couples as well as individuals with troubled relationships shortly after his first book, **Feeling Good**, was published. Because cognitive therapy was beginning to generate excitement worldwide as the first drug-free treatment for depression, everyone thought it might also be effective for other kinds of problems, including troubled relationships.

> you’ve probably noticed that you will usually have negative thoughts like these running through your brain:
> * It’s all his fault. (Blame, All-or-Nothing Thinking)
> * She’s a jerk. (Labeling, Should Statement, Mental Filter, Hidden Should Statement)
> * He’ll never change! (Fortune Telling, All-or-Nothing thinking, Discounting the Positive, Emotional Reasoning)
> * All she cares about his herself. (Mind-Reading, Discounting the Positive, Mental Filter, Over generalization)
> * I’m right and he’s wrong about this! (Blame, All-or-Nothing Thinking)
> * She **shouldn’t** be like that. (Should Statement, Blame)

> Although these thoughts will usually be distorted, you may not realize this (or even care) when you're upset. You'll probably be convinced that the person you're mad at **really is** a jerk, or **really is** to blame, or **really is** wrong. In addition, these thoughts will tend to function as self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, if you think someone is a self-centered jerk, you will usually treat him or her in a hostile or unfriendly way, and then he or she will get defensive and hostile, and will look like a jerk. Then you'll tell yourself, "See, I was right about him (or her)!"

> David and Fabrice then discuss some of the most popular theories about the causes of relationship problems:

> * The skill deficit theory: We want loving relationships, but don’t have the communication and negotiation skills to get close to the people we’re not getting along with.
> * The barrier theory: We want loving relationships, but something gets in the way, such as unrealistic expectations or distorted thoughts about the person we’re not getting along with.
> * The self-esteem theory: You can’t develop loving relationships with others if you don’t know how to love yourself.
> * The motivational theory: We have troubled relationships because we WANT them!

> David also emphasizes that these theories have only two problems. First, the theories that they're based on are false. Second, the treatments that have evolved from these theories are not effective. David and Fabrice describe research on the validity (or total lack of validity) for these theories as well as the effectiveness (or lack of effectiveness) of the treatment techniques and schools of therapy that have evolved from these theories.

> David then discusses the motivational theory which is much less optimistic about human nature, and emphasizes that humans have competing positive and negative motives.

## [055: Interpersonal Model (Part 2) — "And It's All Your Fault!" Three Basic Assumptions](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/055-interpersonal-model-part-2-and-its-all-your-fault-three-basic-assumptions)

Mon, 02 Oct 2017 05:00:00 +0000

David describes the three assumptions of the Interpersonal TEAM Therapy:

* **We cause the very relationship problems we are complaining about**, 
* **We do not want to have to look at our own role in any relationship conflict because it is too painful to have to confront our “shadow,”** 
* **we have far more power to heal a troubled relationship than we realize**, and this can often happen quickly, but there’s a stiff price to be paid.  First, we have to be willing to stop blaming the other person so we can examine and pinpoint our own role in the conflict. Second, we have to focus all of our energy on changing ourselves, rather than trying to change the other person. This can be extremely liberating and joyful, but it involves the exceedingly painful death of the ego. The Buddhists have called this type of enlightenment “the Great Death.’

> Bob, a psychiatric resident named was treating a divorced woman who complained bitterly about her ex, and constantly argued with him whenever he came to visit with the children.

> So how do we help people with troubled relationships? David emphasizes that empathy is always the first step. You try to see the world through the eyes of the patient without jumping in to try to “help.” Empathy, of course, is the "E" of TEAM therapy.

> If the patient does want help, the next step is called Interpersonal Decision-Making. You ask what kind of help the patient wants, and make it clear that the patient has three choices.
> * To leave the relationship.
> * To improve the relationship.
> * To stay in the relationship and behave in a way that will guarantee that the relationship will remain miserable.

> David emphasizes that the last choice is by far the most popular. The second most popular choice is the decision to leave the relationship. And occasionally, you’ll find a person who wants help improving the relationship. As you can see, Interpersonal Decision-Making is simply a more sophisticated way of asking the patient if she or he wants help!

> David and Fabrice guide the listener in doing a written Blame CBA, listing the advantages and disadvantages of blaming others for the problems in our relationships with them. They encourage you to pause the recording and to the written exercise during the podcast, but warn you not to do it if you are driving!

> Then they discuss how to process the results of the Blame CBA. If you would like to see a completed Cost-Benefit Analysis, [click here](https://daviddburnsmd.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/blame-cba-completed-version.pdf). As you can see, the weightings at the bottom have not been filled out, so you can do that for yourself if you like. Make sure you put two numbers that add up to 100 in the two circles. Put the larger number in the circle under the column that feels more desirable. For example, if the advantages of blame greatly outweigh the disadvantages, you might put a 70 in the circle on the left and a 30 in the circle on the right.

> If the patient concludes that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, you can proceed to the M = Methods phase of the TEAM therapy session, which involves the Relationship Journal (RF). This is a powerful tool that David has designed to create interpersonal enlightenment and the death of the ego.

Mon, 16 Oct 2017 05:00:00 +0000

> David emphasizes that the goal of the RJ is not simply to learn how to transform troubled, adversarial relationships into loving ones, but also how to achieve Interpersonal Enlightenment, which is the empowering but shocking realization that we are creating our own interpersonal reality—for better or worse—at every moment of every day! And although the reward of the RJ is greater love and joy in your daily living, the price is steep—it requires the death of the ego, which the Buddhists have called “the Great Death!”

## [082: Neil Sattin Interview — Cognitive Distortions and Relationships](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/082-neil-sattin-interview-cognitive-distortions-and-relationships) - [transcript](https://www.neilsattin.com/blog/2018/03/133-change-thoughts-change-life-cognitive-distortions-dr-david-burns/)

This interview was first published on Neil Sattin's highly regarded [Relationship Alive Podcast](https://www.neilsattin.com/). Although some of the material may be familiar, there's much that's new, and you will enjoy the chemistry between Neil and David as they discuss each of the ten cognitive distortions and raise many challenging questions, such as:
* Is it **really** true that only our thoughts--and NOT external events--can change the way we feel?
* If someone has the belief, "I'm unlovable," isn't that type of thought immutable? How could you possibly change or modify a thought that may be rooted in traumatic experiences and so deeply embedded in a patient's psyche?
* Should we try to change other people's cognitive distortions, or just our own?
* How can we challenge each of the ten cognitive distortions?
And much more!

### [106: Ask Dr. Helen (and David) — My Husband Doesn't Make me Feel Loved! What Can I Do?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/106-ask-dr-helen-and-david-my-husband-doesnt-make-me-feel-loved-what-can-i-do)

This is the second podcast on relationship problems. with Dr. Helen Yeni-Komshian. In today's podcast, we address four questions from listeners like you:

* **Our marriage lacks intimacy. What can I do?** A podcast fan named David explains that his relationship with his wife is no longer intimate; he complains that they only talk about day to day things on a superficial level. David wants to know if he needs to inject some conflict into the relationship to make it more meaningful or exciting.
* **Why is my wife so critical of me?** David wants to know why his wife constantly peppers him and batters him with critical questions, and what he can about it.
* **Why is my friend so critical and dogmatic?** Rajesh describes a friend who argues endlessly and accuses Rajesh of being irritating. His friend says, "Anyone would be upset when they try to talk to you!" What's up? Why is this happening? Who's really to blame?
* **Adarah feels lonely** and tells her husband what he can do to make her feel loved--but it just doesn't seem to work! Why? And what CAN she do to improve her marriage?
I think you will enjoy the lively dialogue between Fabrice, Helen and myself and see us struggling and making some mistakes, too, when we try to model more effective responses based on the Five Secrets of Effective Communication! We also stress, once again, the importance of Interpersonal Decision-Making any time you run into a conflict with a friend, colleague, or loved one.

For more information on healing troubled relationships, you can read my book, [Feeling Good Together](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Together-Troubled-Relationships/dp/0767920821), which is available as a paperback on Amazon. In addition, you can listen to our previous podcasts on the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf), beginning with **[Podcast #65](https://feelinggood.com/2017/12/04/065-five-secrets-training-enjoy-greater-intimacy/) (Enjoy Greater Intimacy) and several of the podcasts that follow.

Today we've got some terrific Five Secrets questions that you have submitted.


* **Mike #1:** I love your Five Secrets of Effective Communication. Why does secret #4, “I Feel” Statements, not include Thought Empathy?
* **Mike #2:** I have seen communication models that include expressing and listening for needs. Aren’t needs and wants important and important to express?
* **Al:** How can I help my wife recognize her many cognitive distortions, like All-or-Nothing Thinking? It seems hopeless!
* **Guy:** If a loved one says, “You never listen,” how could I possibly find the truth in this statement? How could you genuinely agree with an All-or-Nothing statement such as, “You never ….”?
* **Both Sonja and Eileen asked:** How can you deal with someone who constantly wallows in self-pity and plays the role of victim. It's exhausting!

### [154: Ask David - Relationship Problems: What can you do when people "ghost" you? What can I do when my wife doesn't want sex? And more!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/154-ask-david-relationship-problems-what-can-you-do-when-people-ghost-you-what-can-i-do-when-my-wife-doesnt-want-sex-and-more)

**Ask David Five Secrets Relationship Questions**

> **Kate** asks: I love listening to your podcasts and am currently reading my way through your book, **Feeling Good**. I appreciate that you have written and spoken about relationship problems at length, but in what I have read and heard so far I do not see how this can apply to the current climate of casual dating and hook up culture which is fueled by apps such as Tinder.

> **Eli** asks: For some reason, when it comes to sex, it seems that I have a lot of self-worth wrapped up in my sex drive. I’m realizing when my wife and I have sex I feel like I’m on top of the world afterwards. I feel so positive the following few days and I feel mentally and emotionally healthy. But it’s devastatingly real that the reverse is true as well... when we don’t have sex (and particularly when I reach out and she’s not in the mood) and when a week or so passes that we don’t have sex, I find myself feeling very insecure. I feel ugly, unlovable and generally less valuable as a person.

> **Susan** asks: You seem like a good person to ask this question partly because you are a man. Someone I know, I won’t say whom, told me he felt emasculated when I asked him to take my car to the gas station to get the wipers replaced.

> To me “emasculated“ is more of a concept or a thought. I will not get into toxic masculinity and the patriarchy, but I am curious what you think. By the way, this person and I have benefited a lot from your relationship journal exercise, thankfully we did not need it this time :-)

> **Knaidu** asks: Here’s a specific example which occurred whilst I was trying to use the disarming technique. 

> I was meeting a friend of mine, and was a running a few min late for our lunch appointment. I couldn't send her text to let her know as I was driving. I arrived at least 5 min late. When I arrived she immediately said
> 
> "I knew it all along, you really don't want to meet with me or actually have lunch with me!”
> 
> I tried to explain that I was stuck in a traffic jam and couldn't text, but it didn’t work. Here’s what I said:
>
>  “Please Mrs. X, I was stuck in a traffic jam and that's why I am late. Have I ever said I don't want to meet with you? And if I didn't why have I bothered to arrive at all, I mean I could have just not arrived if I didn't want to meet you!"
> 
> After I said that she stormed off.

### [179: My Husband is Leaving Me. I Think He Needs Help!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/179-my-husband-is-leaving-me-i-think-he-needs-help)

Rhonda and David are joined today by Dr. Michael Greenwald, who was in the studio following his recording of last week’s podcast. We address a fascinating question submitted by a podcast fan:

**Sally asks” “How can I help my depressed husband who is leaving me?”**

It sounds like Sally's husband may be on the verge of leaving her. David describes a powerful and paradoxical strategy he described in [Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy](https://amzn.to/2z7FZPS), that he has often used to help abandoned wives. The approach is the opposite of "chasing," and is based on experimental research on the most effective ways of shaping the behavior of rats!

*The prognosis for couples therapy isn't terribly positive unless both partners are strongly committed to each other, and willing to work on their own problems, as opposed to trying to change or “fix” the other person.*

> We place a strong emphasis on the Five Secrets of Effective Communication, especially the listening skills, when criticized by a patient, family member, colleague, or just about anyone. If Sally committed herself to learning to use these skills—which are NOT easy to learn—she might be able to develop a more loving and satisfying relationship with her husband, whether or not they separate or stay together. David expresses the opinion that her fixation on “helping” or “fixing” him might be misguided, and might actually irritate him and drive him away.

> But there is no doubt in my mind that there are many things you can do to improve the way you communicate with him and relate to him, if that would interest you. But this would require looking at your own role in the relationship, as well as lots of hard work and practice to learn to use the Five Secrets.
