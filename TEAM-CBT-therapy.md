### Team Model

#### [001: Introduction to the TEAM Model](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/001-introduction-to-the-team-model)
 
#### [002: T = Testing](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/002-t-testing-a-boring-topic-with-exciting-implications)  — A Boring Topic with Exciting Implications

In this podcast, Dr. David Burns describes the “Testing” part of the T.E.A.M. model. Topics include:

* The shocking results of a study of therapist accuracy at Stanford
* Why therapists who don’t test usually get it wrong
* How session-by-session testing can revolutionize your practice
 
#### [003: E = Empathy](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/003-e-empathy-does-it-really-make-a-difference) — Does It Really Make a Difference?

* How an encounter with a patient with paranoid schizophrenia dramatically changed the course of his career
* The 5 Secrets of Effective Communication
* How to talk with your EAR

Dr. Burns also discusses what therapists can do when:
* you are angry with a patient
* you don’t like a patient
* or when a patient is angry with you
 
#### [004: A = Agenda Setting (Part 1)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/004-a-agenda-setting-part-1-the-eight-most-common-forms-of-therapeutic-resistance) —The Eight Most Common Forms of Therapeutic Resistance 

What is therapeutic resistance? You will find out that therapeutic resistance is **NOT** what you were taught in graduate school or read about in the writings of Sigmund Freud! You will also discover why overcoming therapeutic resistance can be the key to high-speed, dramatic recovery for many depressed and anxious individuals.
 
#### [005: A = Agenda Setting (Part 2)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/005-a-agenda-setting-part-2-how-to-overcome-therapeutic-resistance-dr-burns-i-think-i-need-help-with-my-low-self-esteem) — How to Overcome Therapeutic Resistance: “Dr. Burns, I think I need help with my low self-esteem!”

Dr. Burns suddenly abandons the role of healer and instead assumes the role of the patient’s angry, paranoid and defiant resistance.
 
#### [007: M = Methods (Part 1) — You FEEL the Way You THINK](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/007-m-methods-part-1-you-feel-the-way-you-think)

The three basic principles of CBT: 

* Negative feelings, like depression, anxiety, and anger, do not result from what happens to us, but rather from our thoughts about what’s happening. In fact, our thoughts, or “cognitions,” create all of our emotions, positive and negative.
* When you’re depressed or anxious, the negative thoughts that trigger your distress, like "**I’m no good**," or "**Things will never change**," are distorted or illogical. In fact, depression is the world’s oldest con.
* When you change the way you THINK, you can change the way you feel.
 
#### [008: M = Methods (Part 2) — You Can CHANGE the Way You FEEL](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/008-m-methods-part-2-you-can-change-the-way-you-feel)

> A session with a severely depressed, suicidal, hospitalized woman with rapidly cycling bipolar illness, who’d had 15 years of failed treatment with drugs and psychotherapy.

#### [016a: Special Interview: Can Depression and Anxiety Be Treated in a Two-Hour Therapy Session? with Lisa Kelley](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/016a-special-interview-can-depression-and-anxiety-be-treated-in-a-two-hour-therapy-session-with-lisa-kelley)

“**Do you believe that a depressed individual could experience a complete elimination of symptoms in a single, two-hour therapy session?**” 

> More than 5,000 individuals completed the survey and most were extremely skeptical. David states that ten years ago, he would have felt exactly the same way, and would have dismissed anyone making such a claim as a con artist. However, he has now changed his mind and believes that sometimes it is possible. David explains that he has done more than 50 live demonstrations in workshops and other teaching settings with individuals who are struggling with severe feelings of depression, anxiety, shame and anger. Many of these individuals who volunteer to be the patient have experienced horrific personal traumas. This gives David the opportunity to demonstrate how TEAM-CBT works with someone who is really suffering, and not just a role-playing demonstration. 
 
### Live Therapy Sessions

#### [029: Live Session (Mark) — Introduction & Testing Phase (Part 1)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/029-live-session-mark-introduction-testing-phase-part-1)

> The patient is a physician named Mark who has been haunted for decades by a problem with his oldest son, and he feels like a failure as a father. Although the facts of your life are likely to be very different, you might understand what it’s like to feel like a failure, or to tell yourself that you’re defective, or simply not good enough.
 
#### [030: Live Session (Mark) — Empathy Phase (Part 2)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/030-live-session-mark-empathy-phase-part-2)

> After reviewing Mark’s scores on the Brief Mood Survey, the Empathy phase of the session unfolds. During this phase of the session, David and Jill will not try to help, rescue, or save Mark. They will simply try to see the world through his eyes and provide some warmth and compassion.

> Mark explains that he had two goals in life when he was a young man. He hoped to have a large, loving family; and wanted to become a skillful and compassionate physician. Although he has achieved the second goal, he has felt sad and guilty for decades because of his failure to develop a loving relationship with his oldest son from a previous marriage.
 
#### [031: Live Session (Mark) — Agenda Setting Phase (Part 3)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/031-live-session-mark-agenda-setting-phase-part-3)

> TEAM Therapists use a number of **Paradoxical Agenda Setting (PAS)** techniques designed to bring the patient’s subconscious resistance to conscious awareness. Then we melt the resistance away **before** attempting to change the way the patient is thinking and feeling. 

> * The Invitation Step
> * The Miracle Cure Question
> * The Magic Button
> * Positive Reframing
> * The Acid Test
> * The Magic Dial

> review **[Mark's Daily Mood Log,](https://daviddburnsmd.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mark-dml-13.pdf)** and ask yourself these two questions about each of his negative thoughts and feelings:
> 
> * What does this negative thought or feeling show about Mark that is beautiful, positive, and awesome?
> * What are some benefits, or advantages, of this negative thought or feeling? Are there some ways that this thought or feeling is helping Mark?

* [When Helping Doesn't Help - Why Some Clients May Not Want to Change](https://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/magazine/article/1076/when-helping-doesnt-help) By David Burns
 
#### [032: Live Session (Mark) — Agenda Setting Phase (Part 4)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/032-live-session-mark-agenda-setting-phase-part-4)

> Jill and David encourage Mark to develop his list of positives. Mark draws a blank at first. This is very common among patients and therapists alike. Most of us have not been trained to think about depression, anxiety, shame, defectiveness, hopelessness and anger as being good or positive. In fact, we think of them as symptoms of “mental disorders,” according to the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5). So we think of them as bad, something to get rid of, something needing treatment.

> But after David and Jill prime the pump, Mark is surprised that they quickly come up with a list of 16 positives that are real and powerful. At this point, they ask Mark why in the world he’d want to press the Magic Button and have all of his symptoms suddenly disappear--given all these positives. This is called the Acid Test and it's also paradoxical. David and Jill have now become the resistant part of Mark's subconscious mind--the part that clings to these symptoms. And when the therapists become the voice of the resistance, the patient will nearly always become the voice that argues for change.

> David points out that there is no single tool or technique that triggers recovery in patients. Instead, each component of T E A M contributes in radically different ways to the substantial or even dramatic improvement the therapists are hoping to bring about it today's session.

#### [033: Live Session (Mark) — Methods Phase (Part 5)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/033-live-session-mark-methods-phase-part-5)

> David and Jill begin using M = Methods to challenge the Negative Thought Mark wants to work on first: “There must be something defective in my brain that prevents me from forming a loving relationship with my oldest son.” You may recall that Mark believed this thought 90%.

##### Do you know what the necessary and sufficient conditions are for feeling emotionally upset? 

> The necessary condition is that you have a negative thought in your mind, such as “I’m a failure as a father,” or “There’s something defective in my brain,” but the mere presence of a negative thought will not generally trigger shame, depression, or anxiety. The sufficient condition for emotional upset is that you believe the negative thought. 

##### Do you know the necessary and sufficient conditions for emotional change?

> The sufficient condition for emotional change is that you can generate a positive thought that is 100% true, and in addition it has to crush the negative thought. In other words, the very moment you stop believing the negative thought that triggers your angst, in that very instant you will experience emotional relief, and the change will usually be dramatic.

> As a TEAM-CBT therapist, I think of 15, 20 or even more powerful and innovative techniques that I can use to gently guide the patient to his or her own discovery that the negative thought is simply not true. That's what we do during the M = Methods portion of a TEAM-CBT session.

> You will listen as David and Jill generate a [Recovery Circle](https://daviddburnsmd.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mark-recovery-circle-15.pdf), selecting 16 techniques they could use to help Mark challenge the Negative Thought in the middle of the Recovery Circle.

> David and Fabrice discuss the rationale for the Recovery Circle--you never know what technique is going to work, since people are quite different. One of the many unique and arguably powerful aspects of TEAM-CBT is the use of more than 75 techniques drawn from more than a dozen schools of therapy.

#### [034: Live Session (Mark) — Methods Phase, cont'd. (Part 6)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/034-live-session-mark-methods-phase-contd-part-6)

> Using the Externalization of Voices, which is arguably the most powerful Cognitive Therapy technique ever created, David & Jill continue encouraging mark to challenge his negative thoughts. The goal of the Externalization of Voices is to create genuine and lasting change at the gut level.

> Jill and David also use the Semantic Method and Re-attribution in this segment, and end with a brief illustration of how Mark might interact differently with his son using the Five Secrets of Effective Communication. David and Jill emphasize that this is the "External Solution," and that up to this point in the session they've been working on the "Internal Solution."
 
#### [035: Live Session (Mark) — Final Testing, Wrap Up (Part 7)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/035-live-session-mark-final-testing-wrap-up-part-7)

> After David review’s the phenomenal changes Mark reported from the start to the end of the session, David asks if the ratings were genuine, or, as some listeners might suspect, faked in order to try to please the therapists. Mark bursts into tears and says, in a choked voice, that it was a life-changing experience.

* The testing indicated a complete or near-complete elimination of symptoms. In 2 ½ hours, Jill and David have essentially completed an entire course of psychotherapy. Although there may still be some work to be done with Mark, the hard part has already been completed.
* David emphasizes that he now views psychotherapy as a procedure to be done at one sitting, much like surgery, with brief follow-up visits, rather than a long, drawn out procedure meeting once pre week for months or even many years. 
* David and Fabrice talk about the fact that no one is permitted to feel happy all the time, and that Mark’s negative thoughts and feelings WILL return, David defines a “relapse” as one minute or more of feeling lousy. 
  * This is where Relapse Prevention Training (RPT) becomes so important following the initial dramatic recovery. RPT only takes about 30 minutes and is easy to learn, and will perhaps be the topic for a future Feeling Good Podcast if our listeners express an interest in it.
* David discusses the difference between an Internal Solution and an External Solution. In this session, David and Jill have guided Mark in the Internal Solution—this means crushing the negative thoughts that triggered Mark’s feelings of unhappiness, anxiety, shame, failure, and anger for years, if not decades. 
  * Now that he is feeling so much better about himself, he may want some help with the External Solution. This will involve learning how to develop a more loving relationship with his son using tools like the Relationship Journal and the Five Secrets of Effective Communication. 

#### [141: Two Year Follow-Up with Mark](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/141-two-year-follow-up-with-mark)

##### **Are the rapid changes real? And do they last?**

> Many people complain that the rapid and dramatic change I experienced when I do TEAM therapy cannot be real, and cannot last, and that it has to be superficial or fake. They insist that real change can only unfold slowly, over years, or even after a decade or more of talk therapy. I respect critical thinking, and if you’d told me that such rapid and dramatic changes were possible ten years ago, before TEAM had emerged with all the new technology, I would have thought you were a con artist too!

> Rhonda and I had the wonderful opportunity of sitting down to interview Mark this last Sunday, following one of my Sunday hikes, so we could try to get some answers to these questions. We asked Mark whether he now felt that the changes **were** real, and how he’d been doing in the two years since the session. Did the changes last?

> The interview with Mark was pretty mind-blowing. He confessed that at the start of the session he, too, was very skeptical that years and years of negative feelings could be reversed in a single therapy session. Then he summarized the session he’d had with Dr. Levitt and me in May of 2017, and his tears flowed once again, as he recalled his feelings of failure at being unable to connect with his sons.

#### [049: Live Session (Marilyn) — Testing, Empathy (Part 1)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/049-live-session-marilyn-testing-empathy-part-1)

**The Dark Night of the Soul (Part 1)**

> As the session with begins, Marilyn explains that she was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 (terminal) lung cancer, which came as a total shock, especially since she’d never smoked. As Drs. Burns and May go through the T = Testing and E = Empathy phases of the TEAM-CBT session, they learn that Marilyn has been struggling with extreme levels of depression, anxiety, shame, loneliness, hopelessness, demoralization, and anger, to mention just a few of her negative feelings.

> Although the subject matter of these podcasts is exceptionally grim and disturbing, we believe that Marilyn’s story may transform your thinking and touch your heart in a deeply personal way. Because Marilyn is a deeply spiritual person who suddenly finds herself without hope and totally lost, we have called part one, The Dark Night of the Soul.
 
#### [050: Live Session (Marilyn) — Agenda Setting (Part 2)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/050-live-session-marilyn-agenda-setting-part-2)

**The Hidden Side of Depression, Anxiety, Defectiveness, Hopelessness and Rage**

> There are a multitude of theories about why humans become depressed, including, but not limited to:

* Reality Sucks. 
* Insufficient love and nurturing, or traumatic childhood experiences.
* Biological factors.

> these theories put us at the mercy of forces that are largely beyond our control

> In this podcast, Matt and David take a radically different approach, and argue that Marilyn’s intense feelings of depression and anxiety are not “mental disorders” that reflect some defect in Marilyn, but rather the expression of what is most beautiful and awesome about her. They also argue that there are large numbers of advantages, or benefits, of feeling the way she does, using several Paradoxical Agenda Setting techniques such as the Miracle Cure Question, Magic Button, Positive Reframing, and Magic Dial. The results are stunning and unexpected. Or, as Marilyn put it, this portion of the session was “mind-blowing.”

#### [051: Live Session (Marilyn) — Methods, Relapse Prevention (Part 3)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/051-live-session-marilyn-methods-relapse-prevention-part-3)

**Crushing Negative Thoughts**

> David and Matt move on to the M = Methods phase of the session along, and encourage Marilyn to challenge the Automatic Negative thoughts on her Daily Mood Log using techniques such as Identify the Distortions, the Paradoxical Double Standard Technique, the Externalization of Voices, and Acceptance Paradox. Marilyn emerges as a powerful partner and begins to crush the negative thoughts that had seemed so real and overwhelming at the start of the session.

> David defines a relapse as one minute or more of feeling lousy. Given this definition, all human beings will “relapse” frequently, including Marilyn. But relapses following recovery do not have to be a problem if the patient is prepared for them ahead of time. You will hear David and Matt doing relapse prevention using a number of techniques, including the Externalization of Voices.

> You can view this session as a powerful psychological experience—a “mind-blowing” single session “cure,” if you will—or as a profoundly healing spiritual experience: the emergence, resurrection, or rebirth from the “Dark Night of the Soul.”

#### [052: Your Responses to the Live Work with Marilyn — Are People Honest in Their Ratings, and Do the Improvements Stick?](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/052-your-responses-to-the-live-work-with-marilyn-are-people-honest-in-their-ratings-and-do-the-improvements-stick)

> David and Fabrice discuss two questions commonly raised by people who have seen David's live demonstrations with individuals experiencing severe depression and anxiety. Since the change in Marilyn’s scores were so fantastic, some skeptical listeners have asked, “Was this real, or was it staged?” Others have asked if patients are simply giving favorable answers on the Brief Mood Survey and Evaluation of Therapy Session forms as a way of being “nice” to the therapist.
 
#### [059: Live Session (Marilyn) — 8-Week Tune-up](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/059-live-session-marilyn-8-week-tune-up)

This podcast was recorded eight weeks after the initial session with Marilyn. As you may recall, Marilyn became severely depressed when she discovered that she had Stage 4 Lung cancer. In spite of that horrific and real trauma, she completely overcame her negative feelings in the first session, which was broken down into a series of three consecutive podcasts, with commentaries as the session unfolded.

#### [159: Live Therapy with Marilyn: "What if I die without having lived a meaningful life?"](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/159-live-therapy-with-marilyn-what-if-i-die-without-having-lived-a-meaningful-life)

##### The Secret of a Meaningful Life

> One of my favorite podcasts of all time, and one of the most frequently downloaded, was the [live session with Daisy (podcast #79): “What’s the Secret of a Meaningful Life?”](https://feelinggood.com/2018/03/12/000-live-team-therapy-with-daisy/) You may recall that Daisy and her husband, Zane, were looking forward with dread to the possibility of childlessness, since their efforts at pregnancy had so far failed, and Daisy was asking if she could possibly have a joyful and meaningful life without children.

> In today’s podcast we return to the same type of question from the other end of the spectrum. When we age and look back on our lives, and realize that our days are numbered, we may once again, "Have I lived a meaningful life?"
Do you know how to answer this question? What, in your opinion, is the secret of a meaningful life?
 
#### [096: Live Session (Lee) — Testing, Empathy (Part 1)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/episode-096-live-session-lee-testing-empathy-part-1)

> For the past couple months, Fabrice has asked me to set up a live therapy session to illustrate how to treat troubled relationships using TEAM-CBT. 

*most of us are convinced that the problem is the other person’s fault*

> Today, you will hear the first segment on T = Testing and E = Empathy. Lee will tell his story. Jill and I will listen without trying to “help” or “rescue” Lee. On the Brief Mood Survey, he indicated no depression or suicidal urges. He was mildly anxious and slightly angry. His Positive Feelings Survey indicated that he was quite happy except in two areas: He felt only moderately close to people and only slightly connected to others. You will also hear him say that he felt like one of the loneliest people we would ever meet toward the end of the empathy phase of the session.
 
#### [097: Live Session (Lee) — Agenda Setting (Part 2)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/episode-097-live-session-lee-agenda-setting-part-2)

> David and Jill do A = (Paradoxical) Agenda Setting with Lee, starting with the Invitation: Jill asks Lee if he wants help with the relationship conflict, and if this would be a good time to roll up our sleeves and get to work. Lee indicates that he does want help.

**Step 1 – She said:** 

> Write down **exactly** what the other person said. Be brief:

**Step 2 – I said:** 

> Write down **exactly** what you said next. Be brief:

> Lee also circled all the emotions he thought she was having, along with all of the emotions he was having. 

**Step 3. Good vs. Bad Communication.** 

> When David and Jill ask Lee to examine his response to his wife, he had to admit that his response in Step 2 had all the characteristics of bad communication—he did not acknowledge any of her feelings, he did not share his own, and he did not convey love and respect. This was disturbing and surprising to Lee.

**Step 4. Consequences**. 

> Lee suddenly and painfully discovered the answer to his question of why his wife was so controlling and critical of him—it was NOT because of the influence of her mother, but rather because he was **forcing** her to treat him like that almost every time he interacted with her.

> You will also hear a masterful and paradoxical response by Dr. Levitt when Lee resists—and as a result, his resistance suddenly disappears, and he jumps on board!
 
#### [098: Live Session (Lee) — Methods, Five Secrets (Part 3)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/episode-098-live-session-lee-methods-five-secrets-part-3)

David and Jill do M = Methods, and show Lee how to respond to his wife more skillfully, using the Five Secrets of Effective Communication (link). 

* **“I Feel” Statements.** 
>  * Lee has tremendous difficulties sharing his feelings openly, in a respectful manner. He seems indoctrinated with the cultural idea that men should not be vulnerable and express feelings.
>  * Lee makes the common error of “problem solving” instead of asking his wife to share more of her feelings.
>  * Lee makes another common error of apologizing. David discusses the different between dysfunctional and effective apologies.

> At the end, Jill reads an emotional email from Lee describing how he relapsed and started arguing with his wife, and then remember to empathize use the Five Secrets instead, with an amazing result!

#### [079: Live Session (Daisy) — The Secret of a "Meaningful" Life](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/079-live-session-daisy-the-secret-of-a-meaningful-life)

##### "I'm a failure. . . I'm not good enough. . . My life will be empty and meaningless without . . . "

Sound familiar? Sometimes, the messages we get from society, and the impossible standards that we accept, can lead to enormous, intense suffering.

> Several months ago I received a compelling email from a young woman named Daisy who asked about the message we get from society that lead to suffering. Fabrice and I were so inspired that we devoted an entire Feeling Good Podcast to it [(Podcast 038: Negative Messages from Society](https://feelinggood.com/2017/05/22/038-ask-david-negative-messages-from-society/)) The theme of the podcast, as well as the three subsequent podcasts, was how to pinpoint and modify the Self-Defeating Beliefs (SDBs) that lead to depression, anxiety, and relationship problems.

Today, Fabrice and I are thrilled and honored to present an entire TEAM-CBT therapy session with Daisy, along with her husband Zane.

#### [101: Ask David — Therapy Wars: REBT vs. TEAM-CBT](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/101-ask-david-therapy-wars-rebt-vs-team-cbt)

#### [137: Rapid Trauma Treatment: The Sherri Story (Part 1)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/137-rapid-trauma-treatment-the-sherri-story-part-1)

> There have been many requests for more podcasts on how we would treat trauma, using the TEAM-CBT model. I have done at least 25 workshops on the treatment of trauma in the past several years, and always do a live therapy demonstration at the end of day 1, so people can see with their own eyes how TEAM-CBT actually works. About three years ago, I did a live demonstration with a wonderful woman named Sherrie who was extremely anxious about a traumatic event involving her husband a year earlier. Sherrie kindly and courageous gave me permission to share the audio tract with you. I think you'll really enjoy the session! I want to thank Sherrie for giving us this gift! I also want to thank my co-therapist during the session, Mike Christensen, who is Canada's top expert in TEAM-CBT. 

#### [138: Rapid Trauma Treatment — The Sherri Story (Part 2)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/138-rapid-trauma-treatment-the-sherri-story-part-2)

> This is the second of two podcasts on the Story of Sherrie, who experienced some of the symptoms of PTSD after a traumatic event involving her husband. In the first podcast, we played the T, E, and A portions of the session. In this podcast, we will play the M = methods as well as the conclusion of this amazing session. 
Dr. Rhonda and I will make some teaching comments on the session as well.

> When people learn about the incredibly rapid recoveries that I am so often seeing with TEAM, they always ask about whether the effects last,or whether the dramatic changes are just a flash in the pan. Of course, Relapse Prevention Training is critical, as negative thoughts and feelings will tend to come back over and over for all of us. That's just part of the human experience. And if you know how to deal with these occasional "relapses," you don't have to worry about them, because you'll know how to crush the negative thoughts and feelings pretty fast.

#### [145: The TEAM Therapy Paradoxes](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/145-the-team-therapy-paradoxes)

> In today's podcast, Dr. Rhonda and I will explain why each of these components is inherently paradoxical. For example, when you do the T = Testing, you assess changes in the patient’s symptoms from the start to the end of the session, and the patient rates you on the Empathy and Helpfulness scales as well, When you look at the ratings, you will probably discover that you aren’t helping your patient much, if at all. You may also discover that your perxceptions of how the patient feels, and how the patients feels about you, are off-base, and sometimes alarmingly so.

> When the patient asks for help during the A = Agenda Setting phase of the session, the TEAM therapist doesn’t jump in and offer to help, using this or that therapy method. In fact, the TEAM therapist will often assume the role of the patient subconscious resistance and argue for the status quo, sincerely encouraging the patient to cling to the feelings of depression, anxiety, shame, worthlessness, hopelessness, and anger. The therapist will bring out all the reasons why the patient should RESIST change.

> And finally, during the M = Methods phase of the session, the TEAM therapist will be working with the patient on his or her negative thoughts, like, “I’m worthless,” or “I’m not as good as I should be,” or "I'm hopelessly damaged because of the abuse I experienced as a child." And the TEAM therapist’s goal is not success, but rather failing as fast as you can, trying technique after technique that DOESN'T work and the patient's belief in the Negative Thought is still 100%.

##### Why would a therapist want to fail over and over? Isn’t that the opposite of what a skillful, compassionate, and effective therapist would want to do?

> David and Rhonda talk about the important difference between healthy and unhealthy use of paradoxical ideas and techniques in therapy, and describe how narcissistic therapists may use paradoxical techniques in an effort to manipulate “resistant” or annoying patients. This dysfunctional use of paradox is unfortunately common, and will rarely or never be effective.

#### [116: Spirituality and Psychotherapy: Contradictory or Complementary? with Mike Christensen](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/116-spirituality-and-psychotherapy-contradictory-or-complementary-with-mike-christensen)

> This dynamic interview covers the integration of TEAM-CBT with Christianity as well as Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, the Muslim faith, and more. Mike, Fabrice and I describe many areas of overlap, as well as some potential conflicts, between the teachings and methods of TEAM-CBT and religious beliefs. Mike and I suggest that religion and TEAM-CBT are, in fact, attempting to do the exact same things using slightly different language and symbolism. We strongly agree that at the moment of recovery, a person’s religious beliefs are nearly always strengthened and deepened, and never challenged or belittled.

> Mike, Fabrice and I also discuss topics like religious scrupulosity, religious obsessions, cognitive distortions (John 8:32: “The truth will set you free”), and the so-called “dark night of the soul” described by Christian and Buddhist mystics. We also talk about the spiritual and psychological aspects of enlightenment (e.g. salvation), Should Statements, the Disarming Technique, forgiveness, repentance, the death of the ego, pride vs. humility, and more.

> This podcast features the music of two beloved colleagues, Brandon Vance, MD and Heather Clague MD. Brandon and Heather are both certified TEAM-CBT psychiatrists practicing in Oakland, California. Brandon is a brilliant multi-instrumentalist and singer / song writer / performer who has transformed his vision of TEAM-CBT into music! Heather is brilliant and fun improv acting teacher and performer who is quick in her mind and on her feet! Brandon and Heather have performed at David’s annual South San Francisco psychotherapy intensive for the past several years, and we are delighted to bring them to you up close and personal today!

** **Heather and Brandon begin with music about a familiar but painful theme for nearly all of us—the feeling of failure, and the belief that we are somehow defective or just “not good enough.” Brandon and Heather are extremely talented and successful individuals, but they are not immune from suffering. During the podcast, they describe their own painful personal experiences with depression, anxiety, shame, and defectiveness.

###### The Feel of Failure
*Lyrics by Heather Clague and Brandon Vance* to the tune of “The Sound of Silence” by Paul Simon

Hello failure my old friend
I’ve come to talk with you again
Because my ego softly creeping
Infects my thoughts while I am preaching
And that vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains; becomes the Feel of Failure
 
Fool, said I, you are so lame
Done something wrong to feel this shame
Perfect is the way that you should be
Self-blame coming like a tsunami
Negative thoughts one hundred - percent on my DML
I was in hell
Suffered the Feel of Failure
 
My self-esteem had turned to shit
I needed the magic button hit
Something told me my feelings weren’t lame

Began to do a positive reframe
Maybe my feelings say something about me that is pretty fly
I set the bar high
So I have a Feel of Failure

I saw that I was not alone
Dared go beyond my comfort zone
I took pride in my humility
Welcomed my faults as my humanity

And in a moment of enlightenment I cried and then I laughed
I’d finally grasped
The wisdom... of the Feel... of Failure

##### **Song #2**

“In this song, the singer is anxious about going to a party. She feels envious of Anna, a woman who’s thin (as if that's a good thing) and gets a lot of attention - both because of our culture’s preoccupation with women being thin and also because she has great social skills. So, she feels bad about herself.

“But then realizes it’s just her negative thoughts and also sees that her negative thoughts and feelings helpful to her, and represent good things about her. Then she works successfully on changing the way she thinks and feels.”

###### Negative Thoughts, Shut Your Piehole Tonight!

**by Amy Specter and Brandon Vance**

> **Tiny Anna, you’ve been getting me down. But I know it’s not you; it’s the negative thoughts doing their doo-doo. And those negative thoughts I can leave behind. That’s right, you can walk right out of my mind. You can shut your pie-hole, though you’ve given me a lot during my days. But, I don’t need you now; you can get up and walk right out of that door - and shut your pie hole on the way!**

You’ve been talking since the dawn’s early light
you’re an expert, attention getter, you’re quite the sight!
Anna please teach me
to talk at a party like the talkin' on the tv screen

Now I’m gonna say something and it may not be polite!
Cause I’ve realized that I’ve got some work to do
But this time I’m not going to shut down and stew.

My negative thoughts are bothering me
much more than Anna Lee
so negative thoughts, shut your pie holes tonight.
Negative thoughts you’ve served me well and
kept me from being in social situation hell
Rejection comfortably kept at bay
I don’t have to put myself out there
I can keep myself at home without judgments to fear
they can let me off the hook
No effort to change, to learn new things or swim in another lane

Negative thoughts you’ve kept me safe
But I’m going to try my mind on a different train
Maybe I don’t need negative thoughts and their kind
To tell me if I can have a good time
I can be myself and go at my own pace
Even with these tiny negative thoughts flapping their tiny lips in my face

Negative thoughts said there’s no room in this world for my kind
well that’s just bullshit created by my negative mind
I laugh about awkward autocorrects, Weird-Al and farting
So why not enjoy, the people, at the party?

So negative thoughts shut your pieholes tonight!
Negative thoughts you’ve served me well
Negative thoughts - farewell!
Negative thoughts shut your pie hole tonight

Tiny Anna will surely get some attention
That may be true
And that doesn’t mean I won’t get affection
But even if I don’t have things to say,
I’ll learn to chit chat the Anna way.
So Negative thoughts shut your pieholes tonight,

Negative thoughts shut your pieholes tonight.
That’s right, negative thoughts shut your pieholes tonight! 
Cause I wanna have some **<u>FUN!!!</u>**

##### **Song #3**

> **The last song by Brandon and Heather focuses on the “A” of TEAM therapy, formerly called A = Paradoxical Agenda Setting, and now given the simpler name of A = Assessment of Resistance. We address the patient’s resistance in this very crucial and paradoxical part of TEAM-CBT. When we address resistance up front by arguing for the status quo, the patient paradoxically argues for change, and therapy becomes **much** easier. After that point, it’s No Resistance No Cry.

##### NO RESISTANCE NO CRY

** **Lyrics by Amy Specter and Brandon Vance<br /> to the tune of “No Woman No Cry.” by Bob Marley.

No resistance no cry
No resistance no cry
No resistance no cry
No resistance no cry

> In addition to her brilliant work as a TEAM-CBT psychiatrist and teacher, Heather Clague is a singer and improviser who collaborated in the creation of lyrics for some of Brandon’s songs. She is a member of the performance group, [The Berkeley Players](https://www.facebook.com/pg/BerkeleyPlayers/photos/?ref=page_internal), and is the director of [Berkeley Improv](http://www.berkeleyimprov.com), a Bay Area school of improv that offers improv acting classes for adults and youth. 

> Dr. Brandon Vance has a musical group that is connected with the [Justice Arts Collective](http://www.facebook.com/justiceartscollective) at Chabot College in Hayward California. In that group, he works with students to create musical pieces with social justice themes, often in the style of hip hop with Latin beats. Most, if not all of the students have experienced personal trauma and social inequity. Through music, they can share their truths, their hearts and their wealth of experiences with each other and the community, while at the same time working for social change. 

> Brandon explains that “we form deep connections with each other, and it’s become something of a family . A couple of years ago, we made [a music video](http://www.justiceartscollective.com/) for our song, ‘From Mt. Tamalpais to Fruitvale Station,’ and actually won first place in the My Hero International Film Festival and in the World Independent Film Festival, as well as awards in many other film festivals.  [Justice Arts Collective](http://www.justiceartscollective.com/)

Brandon has also worked with Amy Specter in the creation of a company called [Gameful Mind](http://www.gamefulmind.com). He explains that “we wanted playful ways to support adults and kids in developing skills to be and stay emotionally well. So, we made the game TuneIN TuneUP, as well as some other games and playful shirts and such.”

##### Hearing the Music Behind the Words

This podcast again features the music of two beloved colleagues we introduced last week, Brandon Vance, MD and Heather Clague MD. We will be listening to music again this week, but it will be, for the most part, a different kind of music—it’s the music behind the words when someone criticizes you. 

We will be focusing on the most challenging and important of the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf), the Disarming Technique. 

This week, Brandon and Heather will help Rhonda and David illustrate how to use this technique when you’re under the fire of criticism. But in addition, Brandon and Heather will also sing one more of their extremely beautiful and fun songs, appropriately entitled, “The Five Secrets!”

When you use the Disarming Technique, you find the truth in a criticism, even if the criticism seems untrue, unfair, or exaggerated. This technique is based on [the Law of Opposites](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Law-of-Opposites.pdf). 

Here are the additional criticisms we practiced:

* **Angry friend** who feels jealous / betrayed and says: You were hitting on my girlfriend last night!
* **Irate mother, **who feels neglected / used, and says: Forget it! I’ll just do it myself!
* **Hurt colleague, **who says: You didn’t support me during the meeting!
* **Indignant patient,** who tells her therapist: You just called me Jane, but my name is Lisa!

> If you are serious about learning the Disarming Technique, as well as the other Secrets of Effective Communication, I would strongly urge you to study this list of [Common Five Secrets Errors](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Five-Secrets-Common-Errors-v-5.pdf) in addition to practicing with a friend. I know I'm asking a lot from you, but we are giving you, or hoping to give you, something precious! 

And here are the words to today's featured TEAM-CBT song! 

**She Used the Five Secrets**

**Lyrics by Heather Clague<br />**to the tune of Blue Velvet by Bernie Wayne and Lee Morris.**

She used the Five… Secrets
Madder than angry, oh was I
Pissed and unhappy, I could cry

At the start
She used the Five Secrets
She spoke my words to ‘ empathize
She ‘ guessed my feelings, oh she tried 

From the heart
How could I stay harmed
When she so skillfully disarmed
How could I want to fight
When she asked, did I get it right with
With my Five Secrets

she told me plainly how she felt
Her stroking made my whole heart melt
Into tears
And I can still hear her Five Secrets
In my ears

The Five secrets
Now I have learned to use them too
To give up blame and follow through
And face my fears
And I practice my Five Secrets
With my dears
I love the Five Secrets!
Conflict fuels intimacy

Not about me but about we
It’s more sincere!
So with the five secrets
Let love appear!** **

#### [181: LIve Therapy with Sarah: Shrinks are Human, Too!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/181-live-therapy-with-sarah-shrinks-are-human-too)

> In today’s session, we are very grateful to Sarah, a certified TEAM-CBT therapist, for allowing us to share her very personal and powerful session with you. Sarah was having intense anxiety during her sessions with patients, and her anxiety was bordering on panic.

> This is actually not unusual. In my experience, most shrinks struggle with feelings of insecurity from time to time. But when we shrinks experience insecurities, we often feel strong shame as well, telling ourselves that we “should” have it all together because we are supposedly “experts.”

> Although Sarah brought a Daily Mood Log to the session, listing all of the negative thoughts that were triggering her anxiety, along with many other intense negative feelings, the session took an unexpected turn in the direction of the Hidden Emotion Model.

> We’ve done several podcasts on this powerful technique before, and now you have the chance to see how it works first-hand! Instead of challenging Sarah’s negative thoughts, as we usually do, we asked whether there was something bothering Sarah that she wasn’t telling us about, due to her arguably excessive “niceness.”

#### [180: Feeling Great: The Book and the App!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/180-feeling-great-the-book-and-the-app)

> Rhonda and David are joined today by Jeremy Karmel who is working with David on a new Feeling Great app.
Rhonda begins by reading several amazing emails from fans whose lives have been changed by the podcasts as well as David’s books, including Jessica, Tim, and Mike. Thank you, everyone, for such kind and thoughtful comments!

> David describes his upcoming book, **Feeling Great**, which will be released in September of 2020. It will move well beyond his first book, Feeling Good: **The New Mood Therapy**, all will incorporate all of the latest hi-speed treatment techniques in TEAM-CBT (aka “Feeling Great Therapy.”) David describes his excitement about the team he is working with to publish his latest book, including Linda Jackson at PESI (the publishing company), and Jenessa Jackson, his editor.

> Rhonda asks Jeremy many questions about the amazing recovery he experienced in his work with Dr. May, and how he’s been doing since. Then Rhonda, Jeremy, and David address a number of intriguing questions about the new app. For example, there is tremendous evidence from research that David’s first book, **Feeling Good**, has significant antidepressant effects. In fact, many published studies have confirmed that more than 50% of depressed individuals will recover or improve dramatically within four weeks if you just give them a copy of the book.

> Is it possible that an app that incorporates all the great methods in **Feeling Good**, plus all the new techniques in TEAM-CBT, could be even more effective? And if so, would this mean that an electronic app could even outperform human therapists as well as antidepressant medications?
