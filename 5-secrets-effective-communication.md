### [014: The Five Secrets of Effective Communication (Part 1)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/014-the-five-secrets-of-effective-communication-part-1)

> In this podcast, David and Fabrice discuss five communication secrets that can rapidly transform conflict and misunderstanding into intimacy and trust. David describes an experience that suddenly changed the direction of his life and career when he was working with an insecure medical student from England early in his career. 

#### The Five Secrets of Effective Communication can be remembered using the acronym, **EAR:**

##### **E = Empathy**

* **The Disarming Technique:** You find truth in what the other person is saying, even if it seems illogical, self-serving, distorted, or just plain “wrong.”
* **Thought and Feeling Empathy:** You summarize what the other person just said (**Thought Empathy**) and acknowledge how he or she is probably feeling, given what he or she just said (**Feeling Empathy**)
* **Inquiry:** You as gentle, probing questions to learn more about what the other person is thinking and feeling.

##### **A = Assertiveness**

* **“I Feel” Statements:** You express your own feelings and ideas openly according to the formula, “I’m feeling X, Y, and Z right now,” where are X, Y and Z refer to any of a wide variety of feeling words, such as anxious, attacked, hurt, or sad.

##### **R = Respect**

* **Affirmation (formerly called Stroking):** You convey warmth, caring and respect, even in the heat of battle
David and Fabrice also describe the Five Secrets of Effective Communication and emphasize the incredible power of the Law of Opposites, with a vignette about a severely depressed patient who told David that he was “too young to be my doctor.”

> If used skillfully, the Five Secrets can resolve nearly any relationship conflict and transform hostility, resentment and mistrust into intimacy and warmth, often with amazing speed. And although this may seem easy when you first learn about the Five Secrets, it’s extremely difficult in real world situations.

> In this Podcast, David and Fabrice discuss a number of predictable emotional and mental errors nearly everyone makes when trying to use the Five Secrets to get close to someone he or she is at odds with.

> Can the EAR techniques help a listener deal more effectively with a defiant, oppositional child. Dr. Burns reveals a fantastically helpful secret that he and his wife stumbled across in raising their own children. If you have ever struggled in your attempts to deal with an oppositional child or adolescent, you will find this podcast enlightening!

### [065: The Five Secrets (Part 1) — Overview](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/065-the-five-secrets-part-1-overview)

The Five Secrets introduced in previous podcasts, David and Fabrice will bring them to life with clear explanations and vignettes, and will give you homework assignments so you can practice them, one at a time, between podcasts. 

*In the first two Five Secrets podcasts, David and Fabrice will be joined [by Helen Yeni-Komshian, MD.](http://www.dryeni.com) Helen was David's student during her psychiatric residency training at Stanford roughly 15 years ago, and she now teaches David's at weekly psychotherapy training group at Stanford, and is on the adjunct faculty there.*

[Five Secrets of Effective Communication.](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Feeling-Words-Chart-with-Five-Secrets-v-2.pdf) 

Lots of dedication and practice will be necessary if you hope to use them skillfully and effectively in your relationships with the people you care about. 

David mentions that the Five Secrets exist on two levels. 
* One the one hand, they are sophisticated and powerful psychological techniques that can change your life and your relationships with others. 
* on the other hand, they are profound spiritual techniques that require the death of the ego. 
They require us to relearn our usual knee-jerk habits of arguing, blaming, and defending ourselves when we're at odds with another person.

### [066: The Five Secrets (Part 2) — Disarming Technique](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/066-the-five-secrets-part-2-disarming-technique)

Mon, 11 Dec 2017 18:40:00 +0000

> The definition of the Disarming Technique is finding truth in what the other person is saying, even if it seems blatantly wrong, or illogical, or exaggerated. And it's based on the Law of Opposites.

### [067: The Five Secrets (Part 3) — Thought and Feeling Empathy](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/067-the-five-secrets-part-3-thought-and-feeling-empathy)

Mon, 18 Dec 2017 09:00:00 +0000

> A great question, and David and Fabrice share their thinking. Many people, including therapists, are afraid of the Disarming Technique, thinking that something terrible will happen if they agree with someone who is criticizing them.

> David and Fabrice then discuss Thought and Feeling Empathy

> * **Thought Empathy:** Let me see if I got what you just said. You told me that A, B, and C. (A, B, and C would be what the person said to you, using his or her words.)
> * **Feeling Empathy:** Given what you just said, I can imagine you might be feeling X, Y, and Z. (X, Y, and Z would be words from the [Feeling Words](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Feeling-Words-Chart-with-Five-Secrets-v-2.pdf) list.)
> * **Inquiry:** Did I get that right? Can you tell me more about what you've been thinking and feeling?

> These techniques are invaluable in therapy, and go back to the pioneering work of Karl Rodgers, who argued that therapist empathy is the necessary and sufficient condition for personality change. Although subsequent research did not confirm this idea, there is still little argument that empathy is absolutely necessary for good therapeutic work.

##### Other common errors when using Thought and Feeling Empathy include:
* Helping
* Rescuing
* Giving advice
* Correcting distortions
* Making interpretations
* Failing to acknowledge the other person's anger
 
> **_David encourages listeners (that includes you!) to try using Thought and Feeling Empathy three times each day, even in superficial interactions with people in any setting, such as the grocery store, and give examples of how to do this._** Although this will not be the deepest application of these techniques, the practice will give you a clear understanding of how these techniques actually work.

> Making errors is totally okay in a training and learning situation, as well as in real therapy sessions--as long as you get feedback and try to correct your errors with humility. This can actually deepen the therapeutic relationship.

### [068: The Five Secrets (Part 4) — Inquiry](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/068-the-five-secrets-part-4-inquiry)

> David and Fabrice discuss Inquiry, the third of the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Feeling-Words-Chart-with-Five-Secrets-v-2.pdf). Inquiry means asking gentle, probing questions to learn more about what the other person is thinking and feeling.

> David encourages listeners (that includes you!) to try using Inquiry five times each day, even in superficial interactions with people in any setting, such as the grocery store, and gives examples of how to do this. Although this will not be the deepest application of Inquiry, the practice will give you a clear understanding of how this technique works.

Mon, 15 Jan 2018 09:00:00 +0000

* What do I do if I am using the Five Secrets and I feel angry? If I use the Disarming Technique, isn't there a danger that I might not express my own feelings? And isn't this the same as your "Hidden Emotion" Model, where we don't express our feelings due to excessive niceness?
* How would you use the Five Secrets if you're attacked in public by a narcissistic boss? Should you use the Disarming Technique? Won't that make you look weak? Should you only use the Five Secrets in one-on-one situations?
* Why is the Self-Monitoring technique rarely effective?
* How would you help young people who are being bullied in social media?

Mon, 29 Jan 2018 09:00:00 +0000

We address five questions submitted by listeners who listened to the recent series of podcasts on the Five Secrets of Effective Communication.


## [062: Ask David — The Five Secrets of Effective Communication & Psychotherapy Homework](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/062-ask-david-the-five-secrets-of-effective-communication-psychotherapy-homework)

Mon, 13 Nov 2017 09:00:00 +0000

> Will people manipulate you if they catch on to the fact that you're using the Five Secrets of Effective Communication? Is it fair to ask depressed patients to do psychotherapy homework between sessions when they're already struggling with a loss of motivation?

## [098: Live Session (Lee) — Methods, Five Secrets (Part 3)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/episode-098-live-session-lee-methods-five-secrets-part-3)

Mon, 23 Jul 2018 08:00:00 +0000

> David and Jill do M = Methods, and show Lee how to respond to his wife more skillfully, using the Five Secrets of Effective Communication. Like everyone who is trying to learn the Five Secrets, Lee struggles with several blind spots:

* **“I Feel” Statements.** Lee has tremendous difficulties sharing his feelings openly, in a respectful manner. He seems indoctrinated with the cultural idea that men should not be vulnerable and express feelings.
* Lee makes the common error of “problem solving” instead of asking his wife to share more of her feelings.
* Lee makes another common error of apologizing and using the trite phrase “I’m sorry” instead of encouraging his wife to open up. David discusses the different between dysfunctional and effective apologies.
David and Jill do lots of role-play practice with Lee and give him a homework assignment.

**T = Testing.** 

> *“My epiphany came at the moment I realized I had been afraid of emasculating myself and realizing that my vision of what a “man” should be was completely inaccurate.”*

> At the end, Jill reads an emotional email from Lee describing how he relapsed and started arguing with his wife, and then remember to empathize use the Five Secrets instead, with an amazing result!


### [126: The "Advanced" Secrets of Effective Communication](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/126-ask-david-advanced-secrets-of-effective-communication)

Mon, 04 Feb 2019 09:00:00 +0000

> *Learning to use the Five Secrets skillfully requires strong motivation and lots of practice, but the benefits can be tremendous.* 

> In this podcast, we discuss [three advanced techniques](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Advanced-Empathy-Techniques-v-1.pdf):

> * **Changing the Focus.** This technique can be tremendously helpful when there’s an “elephant” in the room.
> * **Multiple Choice Empathy.** This technique can be transformative when you’re trying to connect with a teenager, friend or loved one who refuses to talk to you.
> * **Positive Reframing.** This technique can be invaluable when you’re fighting with a colleague, patient, friend or family member, and you’re both feeling frustrated, angry, and upset.

> People who are serious about learning can read **[Feeling Good Together](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Together-Troubled-Relationships/dp/0767920821)** and do the written exercises while you read!

##### Can the Five Secrets of Effective Communication Help Us in this Era of Intensely Polarized Politics?

> “How can you talk to someone with whom you fundamentally disagree? My Mom is a big fan of the current regime (Trump) and I’m horrified by what’s happened in the past two years and what’s coming. It’s hard for me to get past my rage at her. . . intensely distorted and not-reality based beliefs, fed by right-wing media. To be clear, she thinks exactly the same about my beliefs and information sources. I feel so stuck. . . and I would love to repair this relationship with her before she dies.”

David and Rhonda are joined again today by David's neighbor, friend, and hiking buddy, Dave Fribush. We appreciate his superb technical skills and thank Dave for his support of our podcasts!

Rhonda starts the podcast by reading a question from a podcast fan named Rajesh, who wrote:
  > I have often seen that estranged friends or family members do not talk or resolve a trivial conflict for years because one or both of them have ego issues or have fear of rejection. This problem of unfairness may even exist between a demanding parent and the child, ranging from secretly resenting to not talking at all. They might come face to face in family occasions or professional settings in case of friendship and bear the discomfort, but not attempt to reconcile.

[Three advanced secrets - podcast #126](https://feelinggood.com/2019/02/04/126-how-to-communicate-with-someone-who-refuses-to-talk-to-you/).

* **Changing the Focus.** This technique can be tremendously helpful when there’s an “elephant” in the room.

> Today we take a deeper dive into Changing the Focus. 
> "When you use Changing the Focus, you gently point out what's happening, and focus on your feelings, and drawing out the other person's feelings, instead of continuing in the same pattern of arguing or avoidance."

> Although this technique can be tremendously helpful, it is very challenging, so I have written two memos explaining the technique in greater detail, with examples. One is for [therapists](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Changing-the-Focus-for-therapists-v-3.pdf) and one is for the [general public](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Changing-the-Focus-for-the-general-public-v-2.pdf). 

> **_you have to be skillful with the Five Secrets of Effective Communication before trying this technique. That's a lot to ask, I know!_**

### [146: When Helping Doesn't Help!](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/146-when-helping-doesnt-help)

> Have you ever noticed that when you try to help or give advice they just keep complaining? This can be very frustrating--fortunately there's a fabulous solution to this universal problem. 

> Rhonda, Jill, and I discussed the most common errors we all make when we lose patience with someone who's complaining, and illustrated the techniques that are effective. As usual, they involve the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-five-secrets-v-1.pdf), especially Disarming, Stroking, and Feeling Empathy, along with some compassionate I Feel Statements.

> We also discussed a closely related and possibly controversial theme--is it okay to use the Five Secrets just to get someone to stop complaining, especially if you're angry with that person and they tend to complain most or all of the time? Do you always have to use the Five Secrets in a totally sincere manner?

### [154: Ask David Five Secrets Relationship Questions](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/154-ask-david-relationship-problems-what-can-you-do-when-people-ghost-you-what-can-i-do-when-my-wife-doesnt-want-sex-and-more)

Mon, 19 Aug 2019 08:00:00 +0000

> **Kate** asks: I love listening to your podcasts and am currently reading my way through your book, **Feeling Good**. I appreciate that you have written and spoken about relationship problems at length, but in what I have read and heard so far I do not see how this can apply to the current climate of casual dating and hook up culture which is fueled by apps such as Tinder.

> I think this may be a significant problem for many of your listeners, and would greatly appreciate your thoughts, as well as any practical steps on how to date in today's world.

> **Eli** asks: For some reason, when it comes to sex, it seems that I have a lot of self-worth wrapped up in my sex drive. I’m realizing when my wife and I have sex I feel like I’m on top of the world afterwards. I feel so positive the following few days and I feel mentally and emotionally healthy. But it’s devastatingly real that the reverse is true as well... when we don’t have sex (and particularly when I reach out and she’s not in the mood) and when a week or so passes that we don’t have sex, I find myself feeling very insecure. I feel ugly, unlovable and generally less valuable as a person.

> **Susan** asks: You seem like a good person to ask this question partly because you are a man. Someone I know, I won’t say whom, told me he felt emasculated when I asked him to take my car to the gas station to get the wipers replaced.

> To me “emasculated“ is more of a concept or a thought. I will not get into toxic masculinity and the patriarchy, but I am curious what you think. By the way, this person and I have benefited a lot from your relationship journal exercise, thankfully we did not need it this time :-)

> **Knaidu** asks: Here’s a specific example which occurred whilst I was trying to use the disarming technique. 

> I was meeting a friend of mine, and was a running a few min late for our lunch appointment. I couldn't send her text to let her know as I was driving. I arrived at least 5 min late. When I arrived she immediately said
> 
> "I knew it all along, you really don't want to meet with me or actually have lunch with me!”
> 
> I tried to explain that I was stuck in a traffic jam and couldn't text, but it didn’t work. Here’s what I said:
>
>  “Please Mrs. X, I was stuck in a traffic jam and that's why I am late. Have I ever said I don't want to meet with you? And if I didn't why have I bothered to arrive at all, I mean I could have just not arrived if I didn't want to meet you!"
> 
> After I said that she stormed off.
