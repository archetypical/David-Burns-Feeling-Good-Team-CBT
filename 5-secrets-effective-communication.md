# 5 Secrets of Effective Communication

### [014: The Five Secrets of Effective Communication (Part 1)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/014-the-five-secrets-of-effective-communication-part-1)

Practically all of us have a friend, colleague, client, customer or family member we aren’t getting along with very well. Perhaps the difficult person in your life is excessively critical of you, complains constantly, won’t express his or her feelings, always has to be right, or never listens to you. Does anyone come to mind?

In this podcast, David and Fabrice discuss five communication secrets that can rapidly transform conflict and misunderstanding into intimacy and trust. David describes an experience that suddenly changed the direction of his life and career when he was working with an insecure medical student from England early in his career. The Five Secrets of Effective Communication can be remembered using the acronym, **EAR:**

**E = Empathy**

* **The Disarming Technique:** You find truth in what the other person is saying, even if it seems illogical, self-serving, distorted, or just plain “wrong.”
* **Thought and Feeling Empathy:** You summarize what the other person just said (**Thought Empathy**) and acknowledge how he or she is probably feeling, given what he or she just said (**Feeling Empathy**)
* **Inquiry:** You as gentle, probing questions to learn more about what the other person is thinking and feeling.

**A = Assertiveness**

* **“I Feel” Statements:** You express your own feelings and ideas openly according to the formula, “I’m feeling X, Y, and Z right now,” where are X, Y and Z refer to any of a wide variety of feeling words, such as anxious, attacked, hurt, or sad.

**R = Respect**

* **Affirmation (formerly called Stroking):** You convey warmth, caring and respect, even in the heat of battle
David and Fabrice also describe the Five Secrets of Effective Communication and emphasize the incredible power of the Law of Opposites, with a vignette about a severely depressed patient who told David that he was “too young to be my doctor.”

### [015: The Five Secrets of Effective Communication (Part 2)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/015-the-five-secrets-of-effective-communication-part-2)

If used skillfully, the Five Secrets can resolve nearly any relationship conflict and transform hostility, resentment and mistrust into intimacy and warmth, often with amazing speed. And although this may seem easy when you first learn about the Five Secrets, it’s extremely difficult in real world situations.

In this Podcast, David and Fabrice discuss a number of predictable emotional and mental errors nearly everyone makes when trying to use the Five Secrets to get close to someone he or she is at odds with.

### [065: The Five Secrets (Part 1) — Overview](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/065-the-five-secrets-part-1-overview)

Is there someone in your life who just 

* won't listen?
* won't open up?
* always has to be right?
* always has to get his or her way?
* doesn't seem to understand how you feel?
* doesn't seem to care?
* is relentlessly critical?
* whines and complains endlessly, but always ignores your attempts to help?

Would you like greater intimacy and respect, and more rewarding relationships with the people you care about?
If so, this podcast series on the Five Secrets of Effective Communication will be right up your alley. Although the Five Secrets have been introduced in previous podcasts, David and Fabrice will bring them to life with clear explanations and vignettes, and will give you homework assignments so you can practice them, one at a time, between podcasts. In the first two Five Secrets podcasts, David and Fabrice will be joined [by Helen Yeni-Komshian, MD.](http://www.dryeni.com) Helen was David's student during her psychiatric residency training at Stanford roughly 15 years ago, and she now teaches David's at weekly psychotherapy training group at Stanford, and is on the adjunct faculty there.

David, Helen, and Fabrice begin with a brief definition of each of [the Five Secrets of Effective Communication.](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Feeling-Words-Chart-with-Five-Secrets-v-2.pdf) They emphasize the importance of intense desire if you really want to learn and master these techniques. They compare the Five Secrets to the notes on a musical instrument. Lots of dedication and practice will be necessary if you hope to use them skillfully and effectively in your relationships with the people you care about. The goal is to help you develop greater  satisfaction in your interactions with others and to resolve conflicts and arguments with others.

Helen emphasizes that these techniques must be applied in a genuine fashion if they are to be effective. If they are used simply as techniques to manipulate another person, they will not be effective.

David mentions that the Five Secrets exist on two levels. One the one hand, they are sophisticated and powerful psychological techniques that can change your life and your relationships with others. But on the other hand, they are profound spiritual techniques that require the death of the ego. And they also require us to relearn our usual knee-jerk habits of arguing, blaming, and defending ourselves when we're at odds with another person.

These podcasts will be for mental health professionals and for the general public. We will give vignettes illustrating challenging therapeutic logjams that were resolved with the skillful use of the Five Secrets, as well as examples  how you can use the Five Secretes with loved ones, friends, colleagues, customers, and even aggressive or irritating strangers.

The Five Secrets require lots of hard work and practice, in much the same way that learning to play a musical instrument will require lots of practice. In addition, when you practice you may initially find them difficult to use, and you may experience some failures. David, Helen, and Fabrice emphasize the spirit of "joyful failure" or "learning through failure," and urge you to check your ego at the door, since the rewards of the learning can be immense.

### [066: The Five Secrets (Part 2) — Disarming Technique](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/066-the-five-secrets-part-2-disarming-technique)

David, Helen and Fabrice focus on the Disarming Technique, which is the first of the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Feeling-Words-Chart-with-Five-Secrets-v-2.pdf). The definition of the Disarming Technique is finding truth in what the other person is saying, even if it seems blatantly wrong, or illogical, or exaggerated. And it's based on the Law of Opposites.

### [067: The Five Secrets (Part 3) — Thought and Feeling Empathy](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/067-the-five-secrets-part-3-thought-and-feeling-empathy)

David addresses a question submitted by a listener after he heard the introductory podcasts on the Five Secrets of Effective Communication. He questioned the value of the Disarming Technique, and protested that every time he "turned the other cheek" he simply ended up with two sore cheeks!

A great question, and David and Fabrice share their thinking. Many people, including therapists, are afraid of the Disarming Technique, thinking that something terrible will happen if they agree with someone who is criticizing them.

They emphasize the value of questions submitted by you, the listeners, and also suggest giving specific examples when they are having trouble using the Five Secrets. Specifically, if you write down exactly what the other person said to you, and exactly what you said next, David and Fabrice will gladly analyze the interaction and show you what errors you made that caused a bad outcome, as well as how to correct those errors!

David and Fabrice then discuss Thought and Feeling Empathy, the second of the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Feeling-Words-Chart-with-Five-Secrets-v-2.pdf). The definition of **Thought Empathy** is repeating or paraphrasing what the other person is saying, so he or she will see that you listened and got the message. **Feeling Empathy**, in contrast, involves acknowledging how the other person is likely to be feeling, given what he or she just said. You can often follow this with **Inquiry**, asking if you got it right, and inviting the other person to tell you more about what he or she is thinking.

Although David does not like formulas, they can sometimes help you get started. So here's the formula:

* **Thought Empathy:** Let me see if I got what you just said. You told me that A, B, and C. (A, B, and C would be what the person said to you, using his or her words.)
* **Feeling Empathy:** Given what you just said, I can imagine you might be feeling X, Y, and Z. (X, Y, and Z would be words from the [Feeling Words](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Feeling-Words-Chart-with-Five-Secrets-v-2.pdf) list.)
* **Inquiry:** Did I get that right? Can you tell me more about what you've been thinking and feeling?

These techniques are invaluable in therapy, and go back to the pioneering work of Karl Rodgers, who argued that therapist empathy is the necessary and sufficient condition for personality change. Although subsequent research did not confirm this idea, there is still little argument that empathy is absolutely necessary for good therapeutic work.

In addition, skillful empathy is for everyone, and can greatly enhance your relationships with family members, friends, and colleagues, and strangers as well. For example, if you have a family member or friend who is feeling anxious, down, angry, or depressed, the skillful use of Thought and Empathy will almost always be far more effective than trying to help, rescue, or "fix" that person.

David brings Thought and Feeling Empathy to life with an example of a patient who criticizes his therapist, and then asks listeners, including you, to pause the podcast briefly so you can write down, from memory, what the patient just said. Most therapists who try this end up "forgetting" or editing out important portions of what the patient said. This irritates the other person, because you clearly did not "get it," and his or her attack or complaining will usually escalate.

David and Fabrice discuss common errors therapists and general public make when trying to use Thought and Feeling Empathy. The most common error involves using the techniques in a robot-like manner, parroting back the other person's statements repeatedly, without using "I Feel" Statements. They illustrate this error with a humorous example.

Other common errors when using Thought and Feeling Empathy include:
* Helping
* Rescuing
* Giving advice
* Correcting distortions
* Making interpretations
* Failing to acknowledge the other person's anger
 
David encourages listeners (that includes you!) to try using Thought and Feeling Empathy three times each day, even in superficial interactions with people in any setting, such as the grocery store, and give examples of how to do this. Although this will not be the deepest application of these techniques, the practice will give you a clear understanding of how these techniques actually work.

David and Fabrice end this podcast with a powerful example of Thought and Feeling Empathy during an actual therapy session in David's weekly psychotherapy training group. The "patient" in the therapy is a TEAM-CBT therapist named Rhonda who became depressed and anxious after receiving some critical therapy from a participant in a therapy group she was teaching.

Even if you are not a therapist, you can perhaps identify with the "ouch" we all feel when we are criticized by someone, and it hits a vulnerable spot. This is an almost universal human concern. It is so easy to feel hurt, depressed, ashamed, anxious, inadequate, and perhaps even a bit angry!

David invited one of the therapists in the group to empathize with Rhonda, as a part of his training, but he ended up with a less than stellar grade. David, Fabrice and Rhonda explain the errors he made--which actually made her feel worse.

Making errors is totally okay in a training and learning situation, as well as in real therapy sessions--as long as you get feedback and try to correct your errors with humility. This can actually deepen the therapeutic relationship.

David then asked Dr. Jill Levitt to try to model empathy again, and to address Rhonda's concerns. Jill hits the ball out of the park and gets an A+ on empathy. David and Fabrice explain why her intervention was so effective, and why the Five Secrets have to come from the heart if they are to be maximally effective.

Jill is a master therapist and co-teaches the weekly TEAM-CBT training group, along with David and Dr. Helen Yeni-Komshian. If you would like to hear more of Jill's fabulous empathy work, make sure you listen to [the live therapy podcasts with Mark](https://feelinggood.com/2017/03/27/029-live-session-mark-introduction-testing-phase-part-1/), the physician who felt like a failure as a father!

### [068: The Five Secrets (Part 4) — Inquiry](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/068-the-five-secrets-part-4-inquiry)

David and Fabrice discuss Inquiry, the third of the [Five Secrets of Effective Communication](https://feelinggood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Feeling-Words-Chart-with-Five-Secrets-v-2.pdf). Inquiry means asking gentle, probing questions to learn more about what the other person is thinking and feeling.

David encourages listeners (that includes you!) to try using Inquiry five times each day, even in superficial interactions with people in any setting, such as the grocery store, and gives examples of how to do this. Although this will not be the deepest application of Inquiry, the practice will give you a clear understanding of how this technique works.

### [071: Ask David — Expressing Anger, Narcissistic Bosses, Social Media Bullying](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/071-ask-david-expressing-anger-narcissistic-bosses-social-media-bullying)

* What do I do if I am using the Five Secrets and I feel angry? If I use the Disarming Technique, isn't there a danger that I might not express my own feelings? And isn't this the same as your "Hidden Emotion" Model, where we don't express our feelings due to excessive niceness?
* How would you use the Five Secrets if you're attacked in public by a narcissistic boss? Should you use the Disarming Technique? Won't that make you look weak? Should you only use the Five Secrets in one-on-one situations?
* Why is the Self-Monitoring technique rarely effective?
* How would you help young people who are being bullied in social media?

### [073: Ask David — Implementing the Five Secrets](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/073-ask-david-implementing-the-five-secrets)

We address five questions submitted by listeners who listened to the recent series of podcasts on the Five Secrets of Effective Communication.

## [062: Ask David — The Five Secrets of Effective Communication & Psychotherapy Homework](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/062-ask-david-the-five-secrets-of-effective-communication-psychotherapy-homework)

Will people manipulate you if they catch on to the fact that you're using the Five Secrets of Effective Communication? Is it fair to ask depressed patients to do psychotherapy homework between sessions when they're already struggling with a loss of motivation?

In today’s podcast, David and Fabrice address two questions submitted by listeners:

* Robert asks whether it would be a problem if you are using the Five Secrets of Effective Communication (the Disarming Technique, Thought and Feeling Empathy, Inquiry, "I Feel" Statements, and Stroking) with someone who is already familiar with these techniques. Isn't there a danger that they might see through you and  therefore thwart your efforts and manipulate you?
* Avi asks about the importance of psychotherapy homework in TEAM-CBT. He points out that the loss of motivation is one of the central symptoms of depression, so aren't we in a catch 22 type of situation since patients might not have the strength and perseverance to do their homework?
David and Fabrice love your questions so keep them coming!

## [098: Live Session (Lee) — Methods, Five Secrets (Part 3)](http://feelinggood.libsyn.com/episode-098-live-session-lee-methods-five-secrets-part-3)

David and Jill do M = Methods, and show Lee how to respond to his wife more skillfully, using the Five Secrets of Effective Communication (link). Like everyone who is trying to learn the Five Secrets, Lee struggles with several blind spots:

* **“I Feel” Statements.** Lee has tremendous difficulties sharing his feelings openly, in a respectful manner. He seems indoctrinated with the cultural idea that men should not be vulnerable and express feelings.
* Lee makes the common error of “problem solving” instead of asking his wife to share more of her feelings.
* Lee makes another common error of apologizing and using the trite phrase “I’m sorry” instead of encouraging his wife to open up. David discusses the different between dysfunctional and effective apologies.
David and Jill do lots of role-play practice with Lee and give him a homework assignment.

**T = Testing.** 

After the session is over, Lee completes the Brief Mood Survey again. His scores indicated that his feelings of  anxiety and anger have completely disappeared, and he also has a perfect score  Positive Feelings Survey and the Relationship Satisfaction Scale. He also gave David and Jill perfect scores on the Empathy and Helpfulness scales and wrote what he liked the best about the session:

“My epiphany came at the moment I realized I had been afraid of emasculating myself and realizing that my vision of what a “man” should be was completely inaccurate.”

At the end, Jill reads an emotional email from Lee describing how he relapsed and started arguing with his wife, and then remember to empathize use the Five Secrets instead, with an amazing result!
